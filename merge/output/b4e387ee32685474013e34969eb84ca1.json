    "fulltext": "Ahead of Trumps campaign relaunch, the Florida Democratic Party is previewing his track record of broken promises. Todays focus is on how Trump abandoned workers. On June 18, Donald Trump shall descend on Orlando, Florida to hold a campaign kick-off rally. As Trumps visit nears, the Florida Democratic Party reminds members of the media of Trumps continued assault on workers for the enrichment of corporate titans. The Trump administration has given corporations a $1 trillion tax cut -- with almost nothing going into the pockets of workers -- while at the same time, gutting workers rights, consumer protections, and denying 4.2 million American workers overtime. Trumps economic record deserves media scrutiny ahead of his campaign kick-off. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried stated: \"Donald Trump should launch his anti-worker, anti-woman, anti-farmer, and anti-minority campaign elsewhere. We are a diverse, growing, and strong state that is increasingly rejecting his reckless, self-serving campaign rhetoric. Hes here because he knows he cant win without Florida in 2020 -- but we know Florida can only win without a second Trump term.\" See for Yourself With Trumps reelection kicking-off, news outlets cant ignore the fact that Trumps economic record is a disaster -- unless you happen to make $1 million or more a year. New York Times Editorial Board: \"Trumps War on Worker Rights.\" \"President Trump ran for office as a champion of American workers and a friend of labor unions, but his administration has systematically favored employers at the expense of workers.\" [The New York Times, 6/3/19] Vox: \"Congresss official think tank finds the Republican tax cuts helped corporations, not workers.\" Vox reported on analysis of Trumps trillion dollar corporate tax giveaway did not increase GDP growth compared to pre-tax projections, or increase wage growth, in fact, wage growth didnt keep up with GDP. Vox found that it didnt help workers or boost economic growth instead, it found that it was \"a plan that primarily put more money in corporate coffers.\" [Vox, 5/29/19] Center For American Progress: \"President Trumps Policies Are Hurting American Workers.\" The Center for American Progress (CAP) outlined 53 things the Trump administration has done to harm working families, from weakening consumer protections in payday loans, reversing a ban on toxic chlorpyrifos, to denying overtime to 4.2 million Americans.
