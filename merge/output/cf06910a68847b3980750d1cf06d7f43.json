    "fulltext": "Caring for any president presents a unique set of challenges. Like all doctors, Dr. Conley is bound by the Hippocratic oath to respect his patients wishes for privacy and to keep secret that which \"ought not to be spoken of outside.\" He is also a Navy officer caring for the commander in chief, whose orders he is obliged to follow. But all of that must be balanced against the publics right to have information about the health of the leader of the free world. And this particular leader, Mr. Trump, is well known for not wanting to look weak. \"I wouldnt want to be in that position,\" said Dr. Stephen Thomas, a retired Army doctor who is now the chief of infectious diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University and a columnist for Forbes Magazine. \"I have sympathy for the guy. Think of it. He may have to tell one of the most powerful people in the world, 'No, youre not doing that, or 'Thats not a good idea.\" Dr. Conley is supervising a team of medical experts at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, including Dr. Sean Dooley, a pulmonologist, as well as an outside expert, Dr. Brian Garibaldi, the director of the biocontainment unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. To the surprise of many in medicine, one doctor not being consulted is Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the worlds leading experts on infectious diseases. (Dr. Fauci is on the White House coronavirus task force, but he was sidelined when his statements of fact about the virus irritated the president.) \"I tried to put myself in his place, and I would have had a ground rule with all of the people who surround the president,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. \"I would have said: 'We have a statement that we are going to put out and then I am going to be asked questions, and Im going to answer the questions straight. If you are uncomfortable with that please have your press office do the briefing.\"",
