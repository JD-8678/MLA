    "fulltext": "Ahead of Trump’s campaign relaunch, the Florida Democratic Party is previewing his track record of broken promises. Today’s focus is on how Trump abandoned workers.\nOn June 18, Donald Trump shall descend on Orlando, Florida to hold a campaign kick-off rally. As Trump’s visit nears, the Florida Democratic Party reminds members of the media of Trump’s continued assault on workers for the enrichment of corporate titans.\nThe Trump administration has given corporations a $1 trillion tax cut — with almost nothing going into the pockets of workers — while at the same time, gutting workers rights, consumer protections, and denying 4.2 million American workers overtime. Trump’s economic record deserves media scrutiny ahead of his campaign kick-off.\nFlorida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried stated: “Donald Trump should launch his anti-worker, anti-woman, anti-farmer, and anti-minority campaign elsewhere. We are a diverse, growing, and strong state that is increasingly rejecting his reckless, self-serving campaign rhetoric. He’s here because he knows he can’t win without Florida in 2020 — but we know Florida can only win without a second Trump term.”\nSee for Yourself\nWith Trump’s reelection kicking-off, news outlets can’t ignore the fact that Trump’s economic record is a disaster — unless you happen to make $1 million or more a year.\nNew York Times Editorial Board: “Trump’s War on Worker Rights.” “President Trump ran for office as a champion of American workers and a friend of labor unions, but his administration has systematically favored employers at the expense of workers.” [The New York Times, 6/3/19]\nVox: “Congress’s official think tank finds the Republican tax cuts helped corporations, not workers.” Vox reported on analysis of Trump’s trillion dollar corporate tax giveaway did not increase GDP growth compared to pre-tax projections, or increase wage growth, in fact, wage growth didn’t keep up with GDP. Vox found that it didn’t help workers or boost economic growth instead, it found that it was “a plan that primarily put more money in corporate coffers.” [Vox, 5/29/19]\nCenter For American Progress: “President Trump’s Policies Are Hurting American Workers.” The Center for American Progress (CAP) outlined 53 things the Trump administration has done to harm working families, from weakening consumer protections in payday loans, reversing a ban on toxic chlorpyrifos, to denying overtime to 4.2 million Americans. [Center For American Progress Action Fund, updated 4/1/19]",
