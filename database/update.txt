-- NewYorkTimes added as RSS link and removed xml file
 -> need to make import.csv or txt for custom and multiply RSS links

-- Added secend Table in DB called state, that is used for evoid adding old news into DB
 -> need to make automated adding new state entries for other Rss link (yet it is hard coded)
 -> implement firstEntry. => should be oldesEntry, because of allowing removing entrys.

-- sql.py extract news from rss-feed, extract Plain-Text with 'soup' and upload it to DB
 -> extend plain-text extractor, for a stable work (not every website could be extractet with soup)
 -> make more error handling (Try-Catch)
