So here’s a modest attempt to do the same for the coronavirus, with statements from officials and right-wing media. I’ve grouped the statements by topic, and used chronological order within each topic.
The course of the pandemic
We think we have it very well under control. We have contained this. I won’t say airtight, but pretty close to airtight. We have done a good job in the United States.
It’s going to disappear. One day, like a miracle, it’s going to disappear. At worst — worst case scenario — it could be the flu.
We’re prepared, and we’re doing a great job with it.
It’s going to go away … when you look at the kind of numbers that you’re seeing coming out of other countries, it’s pretty amazing when you think of it."
1	"If a raggedy sand troll that grants children wishes feels like something out of a classic bedtime story, well, it is. The original conceit, by E. Nesbit, was published in 1902 as “Five Children and It,” and the children’s author Jacqueline Wilson updated the story in 2012 with “Four Children and It” to be about a blended family. Andy de Emmony’s film adapts the latter but has made the household mixed race, added teen angst and wrapped it all into a dull, family-friendly package.
Matthew Goode and Paula Patton play newly dating divorced parents who ambush their respective kids (Ros and Robbie; Smash and Maudie) with a get-to-know-you beach vacation in Cornwall. While there, the children stumble upon a magical creature called the Psammead, which is distractingly voiced by Michael Caine and looks like a cross between E.T. and the Grinch. A cringey Russell Brand hams it up as a local aristocrat who has his own villainous designs on the wish-granter."
2	"Beatrice Ajaero grew up on Roosevelt Island, where she still lives, and has an African food and gift stall, Ibari, which she opened after obtaining a law degree and an M.B.A., in the Saturday market. Her new store, Nneji, in Astoria, Queens, has a limited menu, for takeaway, featuring West African red stew with chicken, peppery yassa with chicken, egusi melon seed and spinach soup with salmon, and a spinach and okra dish. Fonio, basmati rice and garri, which is cassava with a couscouslike texture, can be added. There are salads and occasional tagines. “I always wanted to share the tastes of my childhood,” said Ms. Ajaero, 29, whose family is Nigerian and who studied the Nigerian language Igbo, African history and political science. The name of the store means “mother” in Igbo.

3	"(Reuters) - Netflix Inc will allocate 2%, or about $100 million, of its cash holdings to financial institutions and organizations that directly support African American communities in the United States, the streaming giant said on Tuesday.
The company said https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/building-economic-opportunity-for-black-communities in a blog post it will start with $35 million, of which $25 million will be moved to a new fund, ""Black Economic Development Initiative"", and $10 million will go to Hope Credit Union for creating opportunity in underserved communities.
The move comes as U.S. companies face increasing pressure from investors, consumers and workers to take action against widespread racial inequality after the death of African American George Floyd in police custody.
""This capital will fuel social mobility and prosperity in the low- and moderate-income communities these groups serve,"" Netflix said on Tuesday."
4	"The F.B.I. has issued a warning about scammers who advertise fraudulent Covid-19 antibody tests as a way to obtain personal information that can be used for identity theft or medical insurance fraud.
The warning, issued Friday, is the latest in a series of alerts from the federal government about fraudulent exploitation of the coronavirus pandemic.
Scammers are advertising the fake or unapproved tests — which could provide false results — online, through social media or email, or in person or over the phone, the F.B.I. said. They could claim that the tests were approved by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as advertise free Covid-19 antibody tests or provide incentives for testing.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation recommends that those looking to take an antibody test — which is used to determine whether a person has had the coronavirus — consult a list of tests and testing companies that the Food and Drug Administration has approved. These tests have been evaluated in a study performed at the National Institutes of Health’s cancer institute or by another F.D.A. designated government agency."
5	"[An insurgent wave upended House primaries as Engel fell behind.]
Why is there a delay in the results?
In April, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo expanded access to absentee ballots, fearing that making people go to polling stations would increase their exposure to the coronavirus. The nearly two million ballots sent out by the state’s Board of Elections won’t be fully counted till next week, at the earliest. So Election Day has become Election Week, as my colleague Jonathan Martin put it.
What do the current returns say about the liberal wave that elected Ms. Ocasio-Cortez to Congress in 2018?
That wave continues to crest and shows no sign of ebbing. (Forgive the aquatic metaphor, but it is too swell to avoid.) The generation of centrist Democrats — in the mold of Bill Clinton, and, to an extent, Mr. Cuomo — is facing a serious challenge in an age in which younger, less transactional politicians are in vogue and, increasingly, in power.
What is the state of New York’s Democratic Party?
Dominant. Democrats control the governor’s mansion, both houses of the Legislature and the New York City Council, and make up most of the congressional delegation. Republicans haven’t won a statewide race since 2002, and 2022 — when a very popular Mr. Cuomo seems likely to run for a fourth term — doesn’t exactly seem like a slam dunk for them either.
What can we expect in November?
Most of these congressional seats are safely Democratic, so the winners of the primary will be elected to Congress, barring something nutty. But considering how 2020 has been going thus far, I suppose anything is possible."

For flourish, add a small handful of chocolate chips before baking or sprinkle the finished cake with a little confectioners’ sugar. Adapted from Mollie Katzen’s “Honest Pretzels: And 64 Other Amazing Recipes for Kids Who Love to Cook,” this recipe was developed for kids, but adults love it, too. It’s an ideal snacking cake, or you could gussy it up with a simple ganache frosting.

8	"There’s really no need for leafy greens in a big, meaty citrus salad. The first step is to acquire a range of fruit — citrus of different colors, sizes and shapes, with varied levels of acidity and sweetness. Cutting the fruit so you don’t lose too much juice is key: Cut the pith and peel with a knife, then slice the fruit horizontally with a sharp knife that doesn’t crush and squeeze. A simple dressing of fish sauce, sweetened with a little brown sugar, works well, especially when it’s offset with some fatty pieces of avocado and some fresh herbs.

9	"Lighter than traditional stew, this lemony chicken number relies on potatoes to thicken it, rather than flour or another starch. If you can, buy fennel with the stem and fronds intact so you can take full advantage of every part of the vegetable: the bulb for aromatics while building the soup, the stems for crunchy texture, and the fronds for a fresh, herblike garnish.

10	You might think fajitas are too fussy for a weeknight, but this easy, foolproof version roasts on a sheet pan and can be ready in an hour. Because the ingredients are thinly sliced, everything cooks in a flash — and with little attention required. Smoked paprika, chipotle chiles and a quick stop under the broiler provide the smoky flavor that would traditionally come from the grill. This recipe is very adaptable: Chicken is called for here, but you could also use shrimp or skirt steak. For a vegetarian version, substitute fresh corn kernels, mushrooms, poblano peppers or zucchini for the meat. Cut the vegetables into sizes you’d want in a taco, coat them in the lime-chipotle marinade, roast until cooked, then broil until charred.
11	"Baking polenta in the oven means you don’t have to stand over the pot, stirring the extremely hot, bubbling mass. Here, the polenta is cooked in stock for the deepest flavor. Then it’s topped with piquant crumbles of Gorgonzola dolce and crisp fried leeks, which add sweetness and crunch. You can serve this as a warming main course along with a crisp green salad, or as a rich and flavorful side dish to simple roasted meats or fish.

12	"The Nanaimo bar is a tremendously sweet, no-bake layered bar cookie from Canada made almost exclusively of packaged ingredients. The buttercream layer gets its yellow hue from custard powder, a vital ingredient that makes this a true Nanaimo bar. Use an offset spatula to give the chocolate top a surface as smooth as freshly Zambonied ice. The novelist Margaret Atwood included this recipe, from the chef Susan Mendelson, in her “Canlit Foodbook,” a fund-raising book that featured food from literature, as well as author recipes. Ms. Atwood prefers walnuts in this recipe, but any combination of walnuts, almonds or pecans will do. We’ve added a smidge more cocoa and the optional addition of salt — but leave it out for the true Nanaimo bar experience.

13	"This nontraditional recipe features the ultimate paella cheat: The dish cooks in the oven, as opposed to being actively monitored on the stovetop over a flame. Cooking it this way won’t get you the familiar socarrat on the bottom of the skillet, but the wonderfully crispy bits that develop at the edges of the roasting pan are delightful in their own way.

14	"The amazingly flavorful couscous here is the result of a trick from the chef Mourad Lahlou, whose San Francisco restaurants, Aziza (currently closed) and Mourad, feature a modernist approach to Moroccan cuisine. Freshly steamed couscous is tossed with sizzling brown butter, lots of chopped preserved lemon and a splash of saffron. It is seriously good with just about anything, especially seasonal vegetable ragoûts. (Saucy braises of lamb, chicken or fish also pair well with it.) The recipe below uses spring vegetables, but you can substitute others throughout the year.

15	"The Polish have pierogi, the Japanese have gyoza: Many of the world’s cultures have some version of dumplings, whether they’re filled with meat, cheese or vegetables, and baked, steamed, fried or boiled. This recipe is adapted from the children’s cookbook “Around the World: Delicious Dishes from Across the Globe,” from the American Girl cookbook series, and was inspired by the dumplings you might get at your local Chinese takeout spot. They’re not necessarily authentic, but they are delicious, and folding and frying them is a fun weekend project for kids of all ages. You can use round or square wonton wrappers for this project, but don’t forget the sauce: It’s what makes these dumplings great.

16	"This incredibly easy one-pan dinner is from the cookbook “The Silver Spoon for Children,” with more than 40 traditional recipes adapted from “The Silver Spoon,” a book that appears in many home kitchens in Italy. Older children with some experience can follow this recipe as is, but if you’ve got little ones who want to help, they can stir the sage, beans and apple juice together in a large bowl while the sausages bake, then you can pour the mixture into the hot pan. If you like your beans on the saucy side, add 1/4 cup more apple juice. Serve with buttered crusty rolls and something leafy and green.

17	"Think of this salad as an umami-charged version of a classic Caesar. The central difference is that the egg yolk, which is typically emulsified into a creamy dressing, is plopped directly onto the lettuces, leaving you to break it and let it mingle with the salty, garlicky, lemony dressing, which is bolstered with a bit of soy sauce. (If the whole, raw egg yolks freak you out, swap them for jammy soft-boiled eggs or crispy fried eggs.) The true reason to make this salad, though, is that it’s adorned with chicken-fat-laced anchovy croutons, made in the oven while the chicken finishes cooking. They are worth the price of admission.

18	"The lusty foods and intense wines of southern Italy provide inspiration to spare for cooks and connoisseurs. San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, succulent olives, tender pastas and fragrant olive oils, alone or combined, spell sheer enjoyment. The roots of red-sauce Italian, ever popular in the United States, are in the south — in Campania and Naples (its capital city) as well as in Puglia and Basilicata. This recipe is a riff on the traditional pasta alla puttanesca, with tomato, capers, olives and garlic, but without the anchovies. The recipe goes bigger on the fish front, with chunks of seared swordfish to bolster the mixture with meaty, briny notes.

19	"A favorite Middle Eastern street snack is a small freshly baked flatbread, brushed with a mixture of olive oil and za’atar, the flavorful Middle Eastern spice mixture that contains wild thyme, sumac and sesame seeds. It is uncommonly good. For a more complex, pizzalike flatbread, this recipe adds spiced ground lamb and feta, along with a shower of herbs. But if you simply want the plain za’atar version, omit the lamb topping altogether.

20	"Cooking leafy greens in coconut milk makes them sweet, soft and rich. A spike of hot sauce and some rice or grits makes this a complete vegetarian meal; you can easily replace the butter with oil to make it vegan. The recipe comes from Von Diaz, a writer who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in Atlanta. She combines ingredients and influences from both places in her home cooking.

21	"Versions of seafood “coctel” are found around the Caribbean, usually with ketchup as a base for the sauce. Here, the tomato and onion are part of the salad, and the dressing is based on citrus and olive oil, plus a bit of mustard to make it creamy. It’s a refreshing and satisfying dish for hot weather, perfect with a cold beer at the end of a long summer day. Diced avocado makes the dish more filling, but it is optional.

22	The traditional version of this Greek-inspired dish calls for a whole chicken to be broken down into parts, then braised in a fragrant, cinnamon-laced tomato sauce. This weeknight version instead calls for boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which are are much less work and less time-consuming to prepare. Like most braised dishes, this one tastes even better once the flavors have had a chance to mingle, so it’s an ideal make-ahead meal. Serve it over buttered egg noodles or orzo with a showering of grated Parmesan or Greek kefalotyri cheese.
23	This no-fuss weeknight pasta makes marvelous use of basic ingredients found in almost every kitchen — and calls for some smart multitasking: Get the broccoli roasting while the pasta cooks, then create an easy emulsified sauce using butter, anchovies, red-pepper flakes, lemon juice and a splash of pasta cooking water. A sprinkle of toasted almonds provides texture and crunch. This dish is endlessly adaptable: Go for cauliflower instead of the broccoli (or a combination of the two); use parmesan or any other hard cheese in place of pecorino; opt for walnuts or pistachios instead of the almonds — or bypass nuts altogether and use toasted panko or breadcrumbs. If you don’t have campanelle or fusilli, that’s fine too. Any pasta with plenty of nooks and crannies to capture the buttery sauce will do.
24	Corned beef is really just brisket that’s been cured in salt and spices. Historically, this was done for preservation, but the method of “corning” has remained because it transforms the meat into a bold, aromatic and salty treat. You can corn your own brisket if you have a week to spare, or you can buy one that’s brined but uncooked, which is what is used here. Each one comes with a little sachet of pickling spices, usually coriander and mustard seeds, allspice and crumbled bay leaf. Make sure to fish it out of the package and save it, because those spices perfume the beef as it braises. Get a corned beef made from flat-cut brisket, if you can, as it will be easier to slice into neat, uniform slabs. (The point cut has more striations of fat and may fall apart when sliced.) Serve this satisfying one-pot meal with mustard and beer. (If you have more time, or you don't have a pressure cooker, here are slow cooker and oven versions of the recipe.)
25	The original Reuben’s Delicatessen no longer exists in New York City, but its legend lives on in the form of this classic sandwich. The deli's owner, Arthur Reuben frequently named sandwiches after the actors that would frequent his deli and created a special for Annette Seelos — one of Charlie Chaplin’s leading ladies — in 1914. Mr. Reuben’s version called for ham and coleslaw but morphed into today’s Reuben, which sandwiches corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and a healthy smear of Russian dressing between two slices of buttered rye bread. Homemade Russian dressing has a brighter, fresher flavor than the bottled variety, and comes together in just a few turns of a whisk. The best part of this toasted sandwich is the crispy crust and gooey cheese, so keep the heat low enough to allow the buttered bread to toast while the cheese melts.
26	Okonomiyaki are savory, fried Japanese pancakes that are crisp on the outside and custardy at their core. They traditionally feature cabbage and pork, but this meatless version opts for spinach, zucchini and Napa cabbage. You’ll want to visit a Japanese market for the more unusual ingredients like Hondashi, Kewpie mayo, okonomiyaki sauce and dried shaved bonito, though truthfully you can pick and choose your preferred toppings (Hondashi and shaved bonito contain fish, so skip them if you’re serving vegetarians). The vinegary okonomiyaki sauce combines with the creamy mayo and umami-rich bonito for a playful topping that makes these pancakes truly unique. Leftovers make a great breakfast sandwich filling or snack; reheat at 375 degrees until warmed through, about 15 minutes.
27	Spanakopita, the classic Greek savory pie, is elegant and impressive, yet easy to make. The star ingredient is spinach, and lots of it (two pounds to be exact). This pie tastes best when made with fresh spinach, though you could also use the same amount of frozen spinach — just be sure to thaw completely and squeeze out all the excess water before using. This recipe can be baked a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator overnight, then rewarmed at 400 degrees until heated through, about 15 minutes. Cut into small squares or triangles to serve as an appetizer, or for a more complete meal, serve larger squares of the pie alongside soup or salad.
28	"Traditionally filled with apricot, prune or poppy seed jam, triangular hamantaschen cookies are a prized treat for the Jewish holiday of Purim. This dessert serves as a reminder of the Jewish people’s deliverance from Haman, who sought to exterminate Persia’s Jews in the fifth century B.C. This recipe is fully savory, tucking crumbled feta under thyme-scented caramelized onions, but you could just as easily fill the buttery dough with sweet jam to please traditionalists. When forming hamantaschen pastries, make sure to leave an opening wide enough for the filling to be visible but small enough to retain moisture.

29	"An easy pasta, and a good one for every cook’s repertoire, this dish — known as “drunken” pasta, spaghetti ubriachi (or all’ubriaco) or pasta alla chiantigiana — requires few ingredients: red wine, onions, olive oil and grated pecorino. It can be made without meat, but usually it contains a small amount of pancetta, guanciale or Italian sausage. Well-seasoned and hearty, red wine spaghetti makes a fine impromptu meal.

30	"This buttery snacking cake is a bit like banana bread, but richer, and topped with a sticky caramel frosting that is dotted with crunchy flakes of sea salt. The frosting, made from brown sugar and heavy cream, is easier than a classic caramel, but just as compelling, with the sea salt contrasting perfectly with its sweetness. It’s important to use ripe bananas here. Soft, spotty ones with dark yellow skins will be the sweetest and most complex. Firm, pale yellow bananas just don’t have enough intensity to flavor the cake.

31	"This moist, darkly bittersweet snacking cake is easily mixed with a whisk. Using a neutral oil rather than butter allows the chocolate flavor to shine, and gives the crumb an especially velvety texture under a sweet-tart glaze. You can use any kind of orange for the topping. Tangerines and mandarins (including clementines) are bright and spicy, but regular navel or juice oranges work just as well. Or if you can find blood oranges, the glaze will take on a pinkish hue and a sweeter, richer flavor.

32	"With a poundcake-like texture and zippy lemon flavor, this tender treat is loaded with grated citrus zest and topped with a sweet, mellow coconut frosting. Like many snacking cakes, it’s easily whisked together without a mixer, and quick to bake. Perfect as an afternoon pick-me-up, it goes as well with a glass of milk as it does with mugs of coffee, tea or hot cocoa.

33	This savory-sweet stew is delightfully hands-off — no sautéing, searing or simmering. The key is the timing: Cook the beef first and add the vegetables later to ensure that the meat tenderizes while the vegetables retain some bite. Real maple syrup gives the dish a sweetness that pairs well with the mild bitterness of stout beer. Carrots, potatoes and parsnips are classic stew vegetables, but rutabaga or celery root work well, too. A squeeze of lemon at the end brightens the flavors of this cold-weather dish.
34	"A pressure cooker renders dried beans buttery soft in a fraction of the time the stovetop would take. For this recipe, seek out whole wheat berries — not hulled or pearled — because they stand up to the long cook time, developing a pleasant chewiness while maintaining their shape. You can substitute whole farro or spelt, but make sure the farro is not pearled. The key to this soup’s flavor is the Parmesan rind, which infuses the soup with an earthy saltiness. Finally, don’t forget the finishing touches of lemon and parsley: They add brightness and bring other deeper flavors into sharper focus.
You can also make this recipe in a slow cooker. Find that recipe here."
35	This recipe is a vegetarian riff on butter chicken, or murgh makhani, a classic Indian dish in which chicken simmers in a rich, dairy-laden tomato sauce that’s seasoned with heady spices like turmeric, cumin, garam masala and cardamom. This weeknight-friendly version has a toned-down ingredient list, and the tofu doesn’t require hours of marinating, which means you can get everything on the table in under an hour if you start the rice as the tomatoes are cooking down. Heavy cream gives this dish a rich finish, but full-fat coconut milk makes a fine substitute. Whatever you do, don’t substitute anything for the butter or ghee (sorry, vegans) — it’s the signature ingredient.

37	"The excellent hamburger at Zuni Café in San Francisco has always been served on a square of toasted rosemary focaccia. The pastry chef Annie Callan offers this house recipe: Scaled to a reasonable size, it is easy to put together and fun to make. Bake it in a 9-by-12-inch rimmed baking sheet for a nice, thick focaccia that can be cut into six 4-inch squares (the trimmings are a delicious snack), and split horizontally into a hamburger bun. The baked focaccia can be kept for several days in an airtight container and needs only a brief toasting to bring it back to life. But you can also roll the dough thinner and bake a more pizzalike flatbread, perhaps topped with stewed onions or peppers.

38	"Zuni Café in San Francisco makes a traditional aioli with only four ingredients: garlic, egg yolk, olive oil and salt. No lemon or vinegar, no mustard, no pepper. Quarts of aioli are produced daily, mounted by hand with a wire whisk. You can, of course, make aioli with an electric blender or food processor in a matter of seconds, but, in “The Zuni Café Cookbook,” the chef Judy Rodgers describes how to make aioli with a mortar and pestle, the old-fashioned way. It takes patience, but the result is sublime. Choose a mild-tasting extra-virgin olive oil, perhaps a French one, or use a mixture of half-olive oil and half-neutral-tasting vegetable oil.

39	"Made to exacting standards, the hamburger at Zuni Café, in San Francisco, is legendary. First, grass-fed beef is salted well in advance of grinding, which gives the meat its succulence. Grilled over coals and flipped three times to prevent it from overcharring or becoming tough, the patty is rested, like a roast. It is then served on a toasted square of rosemary focaccia, smeared with handmade aioli and accompanied by Zuni’s acclaimed house pickles: fuchsia-red onion rings and turmeric-tinged sliced zucchini. With all the attention to detail, you’ll see why a Zuni burger sells for $18. It is wonderful on its own, but toppings like Shelburne Farms Cheddar, Bayley Hazen blue cheese, grilled onions or portobello mushroom are also available, and most customers can’t resist a heaping plate of shoestring potatoes alongside. It’s perfectly possible to make these burgers at home, but know that the full project involves several recipes, so it’s probably best to spread the work out over a few days.

41	This one-pan recipe melds roasted fennel, creamy white beans and salty Parmesan, and tops it with crunchy lemon-zested panko. Fennel is often dismissed because of its perceived licorice notes, but the anise flavor is significantly muted after the vegetable is cooked. Tuck fresh, sliced sausages into the mixture before baking to imitate a simplified cassoulet, turn it into a side dish by pairing it with meat or let the dish live as a main, served with a simple green salad and some rustic bread to sop up the sauce. Reserve the fresh fennel fronds for garnish, which add concentrated fennel flavor and a pop of green.
42	Toss spinach-artichoke dip with pasta, and it feels right at home on the dinner table. This recipe, which nixes the traditional cream cheese for a blend of salty Parmesan and heavy cream, is prepared on the stovetop and requires only 10 minutes of active cooking before it’s slid into the oven. As with any baked pasta, the key is to cook the shells until pointedly shy of al dente and to toss them with a sauce that seems excessively wet, as the pasta will tenderize and the sauce will thicken in the oven. These ingredients skew classic, but there is infinite room to riff: Swap in chopped kale or mustard greens in place of the spinach, experiment with cheese combinations, stir in mustard or caramelized onions or top with crumbled bacon.
43	This sophisticated side is easy enough for a weeknight, but fancy enough for entertaining thanks to a few unexpected additions: Seasoned Greek yogurt forms the basis of an effortless sauce, while toasted coriander seeds and chopped pistachios add texture. Roasting sweet, earthy beets concentrates their flavor, and a splash of balsamic balances out their sweetness. This dish can be prepared in advance and served hot, cold or at room temperature, but its assembly should be done just before serving so the toasted coriander seeds and roasted pistachios retain their crunch.
44	An electric pressure cooker makes quick work of this Italian-style lentil soup, which tastes like it has simmered away on the stovetop for hours. (If time is on your side, get the slow cooker version of this recipe here.) You could use any brown or black lentils, but beluga lentils are ideal because they get creamy on the inside while retaining their shape. (Other lentils may fall apart, but the soup will be no less delicious.) Determine your leafy green selection by what the market has to offer, keeping in mind that heartier types will retain more bite. Finish the soup with a hit of red-wine vinegar and a sprinkle of fresh basil for bright, fresh flavor.
45	"This sheet-pan recipe is an easy way to get a hearty vegetarian meal on the table in under an hour. Inspired by panzanella, which traditionally provides new life for stale bread by tossing it with juicy tomatoes, this bread salad instead gets its moisture from an earthy tahini dressing. The creamy tahini is lightly sweetened with honey, which plays well with the buttery squash, while a flourish of fresh herbs adds a light, springy finish. This makes for a nice supper on its own, but it would also work well as a side to roasted chicken or fish.

46	Cure beef brisket in a salty, spiced brine and it becomes savory, tangy and aromatic corned beef. Get a corned beef made from flat-cut brisket, if you can, as it will be easier to slice into neat, uniform slabs. (The point cut has more striations of fat and may fall apart when sliced.) Braise the meat until tender, and add the vegetables toward the end of the braising time so they’ll absorb the beef juices and soften until perfectly crisp-tender. Finish the beef with a simple honey-mustard glaze and a quick broil to caramelize, then serve it with more Dijon mustard and beer. (Here are slow cooker and pressure cooker versions of the recipe.)
47	This classic poundcake has a boozy twist that’s perfect for parties, St. Patrick’s Day and beyond. Irish cream liqueur — a rich blend of Irish whiskey, cream, sugar, vanilla and other flavorings — is added to both the batter and the glaze, which yields doubly flavorful results. The alcohol in the cake burns off during baking, but if you’d like to mute the hint of alcohol in the glaze, simply bring the Irish cream to a simmer and let it cool before whisking it with the confectioners’ sugar. Serve the cake alone, with a scoop of coffee ice cream or a hot cup of coffee (spiked with Irish cream, perhaps). The cake keeps well at room temperature, tightly wrapped, for up to 4 days.
48	Corned beef — brisket cured in brine — is beloved for its big, salty, aromatic flavor. It needs to be braised or simmered for a long time to become tender and sliceable, making it an ideal slow cooker dish. Get a corned beef made from flat-cut brisket, if you can, as it will be easier to slice into neat, uniform slabs. (The point cut has more striations of fat and may fall apart when sliced.) Corned beef is often braised in beer, and you could certainly do that, but a slightly sweet wine, like a semi-dry Riesling, balances the beef’s saltiness. Finish with a simple honey-mustard glaze and a quick trip under the broiler. Serve this satisfying one-pot meal with mustard and enjoy with beer. (Here are pressure cooker and oven versions of the recipe.)
49	This is a thick, rich braise that makes good use of root vegetables. Pick whichever roots you like best; carrots and rutabaga work particularly well together; celery root and parsnips are very nice, too. This is not a toss-it-in-and-go kind of slow cooker recipe: It takes a little time to brown the beef and make a roux-thickened gravy, but those steps build flavor and ensure that you end up with a hearty stew rather than watery soup. Get everything going in the slow cooker — prepare the night before if you have the time — and the stew will be ready the moment you step in the door at suppertime. The horseradish sour cream comes together in minutes and makes a fresh, tangy topping for the mellow stew. (Here are pressure cooker and oven versions of the recipe.)
50	"The only federal race in the nation’s capital is the election for the District of Columbia’s nonvoting representative in Congress. Read more
Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who has been in the House since 1991, is heavily favored for re-election, as is Muriel E. Bowser in her bid for a second term as mayor.
Also at stake: seven seats on the 13-member Council, which effectively functions as both a city council and a state legislature (with congressional oversight). The District of Columbia is among the most Democratic areas of the nation: President Trump won just 4 percent of the city’s vote in 2016."
51	"Election Day promises considerable drama, but don’t expect much of it to come from Delaware. Both Democratic incumbents up for re-election — Senator Tom Carper, who has already served three terms, and Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester, the state’s first woman and first African-American to win election to the House — are expected to win easily. Read more
Mr. Carper is being challenged by Rob Arlett, a county councilman who served as President Trump’s state campaign chair in 2016, and Ms. Blunt Rochester faces Scott Walker, a Republican who waded into hot water with his party when he went on a name-calling tirade on Facebook, accusing his opponent and other Democrats of racism.
The marquee battle here took place in September, when the centrist Mr. Carper, 71, turned back a primary challenge from a first-time progressive insurgent candidate, Kerri Harris, 38, winning 65 percent of the vote."
52	"Connecticut is known as the Land of Steady Habits, except when it comes to party control of the governorship. In general, the state is reliably blue, voting for the Democrat in every presidential election since 1992, and polls suggest that it’s all-Democratic congressional delegation will stay that way after Election Day. Read more
In the Fifth District, Jahana Hayes, a political newcomer, is favored to become the first black Democrat to represent the state in Congress.
But the governorship, which switched party hands in 2010, is up for grabs again. With the deeply unpopular Democratic incumbent, Gov. Dannel Malloy, declining to run again, Ned Lamont, a Democrat and familiar figure from his past bids for governor and senator, faces a competitive challenge from Bob Stefanowski, a Republican business executive. Complicating the race is an independent candidate, Oz Griebel, who appeared in some polls to be attracting enough support to potentially affect the outcome."
53	"The Golden State has battlegrounds aplenty in the midterms, and if the Democrats are to achieve their goal of gaining control of the House, they will need to prevail in many of them. Read more
At the top of the ticket, Gavin Newsom won the race to replace Governor Jerry Brown. The Democrat, who is the state’s Lieutenant Governor, defeated his Republican opponent, John Cox, without difficulty. With a comfortable lead, Mr. Newsom has been able to devote some time to campaigning for other Democrats in more difficult races where victories could help his party reshape Washington.
As always, results trickle in slowly from the West Coast, but Devin Nunes, chairman of the House intelligence committee, has retained his seat in the 22nd district."
54	"Unlike most Southern states, Arkansas has not been a bastion of absolute Republican power for more than a decade. But Election Day results could easily set it on that course. Read more

55	A 12-member commission would be created to approve boundary maps for state legislative districts. The measure would also establish requirements for the maps and for who can serve on the commission, including restrictions on prior and current elected officials.
56	"Arizona is home to one of the most closely eyed midterm battles this cycle: the race to fill the seat of a retiring Republican, Senator Jeff Flake. Read more
Two of the state’s representatives — Martha McSally, the hawkish President Trump ally, and Kyrsten Sinema, an activist-turned-moderate — are duking it out in a tight and vicious battle to claim the title of the state’s first female senator.
But there are other important elections on the ballot for Arizonans. Gov. Doug Ducey, the Republican former chief executive of Cold Stone Creamery, holds the upper hand against David Garcia, a Democrat and professor at Arizona State University, who has made education a central issue of his campaign. Mr. Ducey, on the other hand, is running on a platform of jobs and border security, and in recent months has more closely aligned himself with Mr. Trump."
