Fact Check: The video, taken from above, shows officers unloading bricks from the back of what appears to be a police vehicle. Two people behind the camera can be heard questioning the actions of the officers below.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “If you know how, save this to your phone,” urges the caption. “Boston Police planting bricks amid protests.” (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show SUV Driving Through A Minneapolis Mall During George Floyd Protests) Social media users shared the video amid reports that bricks have been staged near protest sites to encourage violence. In many cities across the U.S., protests and riots have occurred following the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident. However, the video doesn’t depict officers “planting” bricks. The Northeastern University Police Department, whose officers appear in the footage, refuted the claim on Facebook. “On Monday, June 1, while on a routine patrol of campus, two of our officers came across a damaged brick sidewalk at the corner of Tremont and Coventry streets that posed a safety hazard for pedestrians due to loose, upturned and broken bricks,” the Northeastern University Police Department wrote. “To prevent injuries to pedestrians, the officers collected the bricks and returned them to NUPD headquarters, where they immediately notified the City of Boston of a need for repair to the sidewalk and to request that the city collect the broken and damaged bricks.”  The department said the video being shared “is from the series of events described here.” The city confirmed it was notified about the bricks being removed, according to the Associated Press.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/roguednc/videos/886215608548007/,https://www.facebook.com/roguednc/videos/886215608548007/,https://www.facebook.com/roguednc/videos/886215608548007/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/06/02/fact-check-video-suv-driving-minneapolis-mall-george-floyd-protests/,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/investigating-bricks-at-protests,https://news.sky.com/story/who-was-george-floyd-the-gentle-giant-who-loved-his-hugs-11997206#:~:text=Mr%20Floyd%20was%20an%20unarmed,to%20turn%20his%20life%20around.,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/05/us/minneapolis-officers-background-george-floyd-trnd/index.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html,https://www.facebook.com/northeasternpd/posts/1401038196769858,https://www.facebook.com/northeasternpd/posts/1401038196769858,https://www.facebook.com/northeasternpd/posts/1401038196769858,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:9004640177,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#02767067746d704266636b6e7b61636e6e67702c616d6f",Does This Video Show Boston Police ‘Planting’ Bricks At George Floyd Protest Locations?,,,,,

A spokesperson for the National Mall and Memorial Parks confirmed that the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington has not been vandalized. Fact Check: The image, purportedly taken after recent protests in Washington, shows what appears to be the Vietnam Veterans Memorial marred by graffiti, with the caption claiming, “Rioters deface Vietnam War Memorial.” Facebook users shared the photo amid protests and riots occurring in major U.S. cities following the death of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The caption’s claim is inaccurate, however. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Protesters Breaking Into The White House?) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the image dates back to 2016. The graffiti resembles that in similar photos from media reports about a painted replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Los Angeles being vandalized that year. The man who vandalized the replica was sentenced to four years in state prison, according to the Los Angeles Times. “There has been no graffiti or vandalism of any kind to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial or its grounds,” Mike Litterst, chief of communications for the National Mall and Memorial Parks, said in an email to the Caller. Other monuments, including the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II Memorial, sustained some damage during D.C. protests following Floyd’s death, CNN reported. The graffiti on those monuments has since been removed, according to Litterst.  This isn’t the first time social media users have shared photos that they claim show damage from protesters. The Caller previously debunked a fake photo of the Lincoln Memorial covered in graffiti and missing a chunk from the statue’s head.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Graffiti at the Lincoln Memorial was “limited to the plinth at the bottom of the steps,” according to a spokesperson from the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Fact Check: Several monuments and memorials on the National Mall were defaced with graffiti during protests that erupted in Washington, D.C., following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, CNN reported.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    One image, purportedly taken during the aftermath of such protests, shows the statue of Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial covered in graffiti and missing a chunk from his head. Phrases such as “Black + Brown Lives Matter” and “#BLM” have allegedly been spray-painted on and near Lincoln’s likeness, according to the photo. “This picture was taken down,” reads the caption. “I guess the left is trying to hide what they did to honest abe.” (RELATED: Trump Says Lincoln Was Ridiculed For The Gettysburg Address) Mike Litterst, chief of communications for the National Mall and Memorial Parks, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the photo is fake, however. “The picture is 100% fake,” said Litterst in an email. “Graffiti at the Lincoln Memorial was limited to the plinth at the bottom of the steps, well away from the statue (and it has been removed).”  The official Twitter account for the National Mall and Memorial Parks tweeted photos of the actual damage done to the monuments, which included the phrase “Yall not tired yet?” spray-painted on the Lincoln Memorial’s plinth.

Fact Check: Numerous companies have responded to protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody, with condemnations of racism and support for racial equality, according to CNN. In this case, a Facebook post claims Starbucks has shown support for the Black Lives Matter movement through a drink promotion.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The alleged promotion shows the hands of two people, one white and one black, holding up what appear to be Frappuccinos. Above the image, text reads, “We’re all in this together, Black Lives Matter! Come to any of our stores shouting these words for a free Frappuccino of your choice. The louder you shout, the larger the size you’ll get!” But the Starbucks promotion is fake. A spokesperson for the company confirmed it was not a valid offer to the Daily Caller News Foundation. (RELATED: Is Starbucks Offering Free Drinks To People Of Color?) “This is not a valid Starbucks offer,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our customers may confirm any Starbucks promotion, by checking the Starbucks app, reaching out to our customer care line, or asking a Starbucks barista.” This is not the first time Starbucks has been the target of a fake promotion. In February, Twitter users widely shared a digital coupon that falsely claimed Starbucks would give free drink vouchers to people who posted pictures of themselves listening to Lady Gaga’s song “Stupid Love.”  Starbucks has made public statements following Floyd’s death. On Twitter, the company tweeted a statement promising to “confront racism to create a more inclusive and just world.” The company also held a forum “for any Starbucks partners who felt compelled to join a conversation about the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and the many other racial injustices that have shaken the entire country and each one of us,” according to a letter from CEO Kevin Johnson.

A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department said the claim “appears to be misinformation.” Fact Check:  Protests and riots have erupted in D.C. and other major U.S. cities following the death of Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to USA Today.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image, which appears to be a screen grab from the Twitter account associated with the hacker group Anonymous, claims that the nation’s capital experienced a communications blackout in the early hours of June 1, saying, “The US government cut all communications in D.C. from 1AM to 6AM the fate of the protestors or events during this period is currently unknown.” There is, however, no evidence that a communications blackout occurred, and the hashtag “#DCblackout” appears to be a viral hoax that spread on Twitter.

To be fair, we didn’t see descriptions clearly matching a jamming scenario either but that doesn’t mean it hasn’t happened.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Spokespeople for Verizon and AT&T confirmed their phone networks operated normally that night, according to local CBS affiliate WUSA. Alaina Gertz, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department, told the Caller in an email, “This appears to be misinformation. We have no confirmation of a cell phone blackout.” Yahoo News reporter Hunter Walker and CBS News reporter Christina Ruffini, among others, also pushed back on the claim. (RELATED: Donald Trump Claims DC Mayor ‘Wouldn’t Let The DC Police Get Involved’ With May 29 White House Protest) “Stop retweeting #dcblackout.

Many of these tweets are the same wording.

Bloomberg reported that a Twitter spokesperson said the platform suspended hundreds of accounts perpetuating the baseless claim about a communications failure during D.C. protests. The move was part of an active investigation into the “#DCblackout” hashtag, the spokesperson told Bloomberg.

Fact Check: The flyer, which features an image of a bandana-wearing man throwing a bouquet, seeks a “professional anarchist” that will allegedly be compensated $200 per “direct action.” The phrase “Funded by George Soros” can be found at the bottom of the flyer, along with the logo for Soros’ Open Society Foundations and the supposed contact information for the Thurston County Democrats of Washington.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Social media users shared the photo of the alleged flyer as protests and riots erupted in major U.S. cities following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident. Similar claims about Soros paying protesters have previously circulated in 2015 and 2018. However, the flyer does not appear to be authentic.

Victor Minjares, the chair of the Thurston County Democrats, wrote a lengthy post on Facebook denying that the flyer was real.   “False and forged images are being spread nationwide that say, ‘Get paid to be a professional anarchist,'” Minjares wrote. “This disinformation displays TCD’s phone number and an incorrect TCD email/web address.

Fact Check: DeGeneres is a comedian and the host of the talk show “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.” The post, shared more than 3,600 times since May 31, alleges, “Ellen degeneres is on house arrest for child sex trafficking.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to substantiate the claim. Celebrities often make headlines when they have run-ins with the law. Had DeGeneres faced a child sex trafficking charge, it would have been picked up by the media, yet none have reported on it. Additionally, DeGeneres is a California resident, and California state law mandates that anyone convicted of sex trafficking must register as a sex offender. A search for her name on California’s sex offender registry website turned up no matches. It also appears nowhere on the Department of Justice’s national sex offender registry. The accusation may be related to a baseless rumor shared on alternative news websites, like Our New Earth News, that DeGeneres is currently wearing an ankle monitor. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Ellen DeGeneres Is Giving Away $5,000 To 100 People Who Like And Comment On It) This isn’t the first time a celebrity has been the target of false claims of arrest in connection to sex trafficking. In March, social media users widely shared posts making such claims about television personality Oprah Winfrey, despite them originating in a QAnon conspiracy theory, according to the Washington Post.  DeGeneres did not return a request for comment. Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Mayor Muriel Bowser “wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved” with a recent protest near the White House.  ….good practice.” As you saw last night, they were very cool & very professional. Never let it get out of hand. Thank you! On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. “Not their job.” Nice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2020  Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Statements from the Secret Service and Bowser indicate that D.C. police were on the scene. The chief of police said his department established “unified command” with the Secret Service and Park Police and provided some equipment to the Secret Service. Fact Check: Protests and riots have erupted in cities across the U.S. following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident. On May 29, protesters gathered outside the White House, which was briefly put on lockdown, with some pushing at barricades erected by the Secret Service and throwing things, the Washington Post reported. Trump praised the Secret Service’s response to the protests on Twitter the following day, adding, “On the bad side, the D.C. Mayor, @MurielBowser, who is always looking for money & help, wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. ‘Not their job.’ Nice!”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But Trump’s claim doesn’t hold up. The Secret Service said in a May 30 statement regarding the previous night’s protests that the “Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Park Police were on the scene.” Reporters at the scene also noticed a D.C. police presence at protests.  People have managed to toss over the temporary barricades, they’re being pushed back by the Secret Service. More police arriving.

(RELATED: Viral Image Claims MSNBC Aired ‘World War Z’ Clip During George Floyd Protest Coverage) “No one needed to ask the Metropolitan Police Department to get involved, because we were already involved,” she said. “Our police were doing their jobs from the start. D.C. Police supported uniformed Secret Service last night like we have done literally dozens of times at Lafayette Park.”  D.C. Chief of Police Peter Newsham told reporters at the same news conference that his department established “unified command” with the Park Police and Secret Service and even provided Secret Service agents with equipment they didn’t have, such as helmets.

The original photo dates back to before President Donald Trump took office. Fact Check:  Social media users widely shared the photo, which appears to show the White House with all exterior and interior lights off, along with claims that it was taken as the Secret Service escorted Trump to the bunker on May 31. The Associated Press reported that Trump spent nearly an hour in the White House bunker on May 29, as hundreds of people gathered outside to protest following the death of Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Photo for the ages,” reads the accompanying text. “Last night, while we were dealing with a global pandemic with at least 106,000 people dead in the U.S., the worst job market since the Depression with more than 40 million people unemployed, and protests against racial injustice and institutional bigotry raging across the country, the White House turned off the lights and Trump hid in his bunker, unwilling to address the nation.” However, the photo is not from 2020, and it appears to have been digitally manipulated. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Protesters Breaking Into The White House?) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found the unedited photo uploaded to Getty Images’ stock website in December 2015. The same picture also appears on the stock photo website Alamy, where the description says it was taken on July 9, 2014. In the photos on the stock websites, the lantern hanging from the portico is lit, as well as lights around the fountain. The edited version has been darkened, and the lit lantern has been digitally removed, according to the Associated Press.  Photos taken for Reuters late May 31 and early June 1 show the White House with various levels of lighting. CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins noted on Twitter that lights at the White House “go off every night.”  As someone who has done many late night live shots, the lights at the White House go off every night around 11 p.m. — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) June 1, 2020   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “As someone who has done many late night live shots, the lights at the White House go off every night around 11 p.m.,” she tweeted.

Fact Check: Protests and riots have occurred in cities across the country following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after an officer knelt on his neck for over eight minutes, according to video of the incident. There have been a number of demonstrations in Columbus, according to the Columbus Dispatch.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image shows a screen grab of another Facebook post featuring two smoke-filled photos taken in Columbus. The caption, seemingly referencing OhioHealth Grant Medical Center and Nationwide Children’s Hospital, reads, “If you believe that the ‘protests’ are still ok, you’re out of your mind!! Setting a Children’s hospital and Grant on fire is beyond protesting.” Contrary to the post’s claims, neither hospital has caught fire during recent protests in Columbus. Spokespeople for OhioHealth, the hospital system that manages Grant Medical Center, and Nationwide Children’s Hospital confirmed as much in emails to the Daily Caller. “I verified with both our facilities and security teams,” Katie Logan, an OhioHealth spokesperson, said in an email. “We have not had any fires at OhioHealth Grant Medical Center in the last 30 days.” “The fire was not on our property,” Katelyn Hanzel, a senior media relations specialist at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, confirmed.

There is no evidence to suggest the coronavirus was genetically modified. Fact Check: Unfounded rumors that the new coronavirus was man-made have been circulating the internet since the beginning of the pandemic, according to Forbes. In recent weeks, social media users have attempted to link the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, to HIV to suggest the new virus is genetically modified.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Those little spikes that come out of the Coronavirus and make it attach inside our lungs so efficiently are Spike Glycoproteins, better known as S-proteins for short. Well the Covid-19 strain that’s currently going around has S-protein 120 spikes,” reads the post. “S-protein 120 is only found in one other virus known to man, HIV. Meaning the current Covid-19 strain was indeed genetically modified by the insertion of these HIV proteins into the Coronavirus and therefore weaponizing it.” But experts refute the claim. While the coronavirus does have spike glycoproteins, they are not the same as those found in HIV. (RELATED: No, A Harvard Professor Was Not Arrested For Manufacturing And Selling The Coronavirus To China) “Many enveloped viruses have S or spike glycoproteins. They are all different: influenza virus, measles virus, SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, Ebolavirus, and on and on,” explained Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “To think that SARS-CoV-2 has the spike of HIV-1 is the ultimate ignorance; and using this ignorance to say the SARS-CoV-2 spike came from HIV-1 (not even close, one can look at the protein sequence and see that) should only be believed by those who do not know better.” Dr. Phyllis Kanki, a professor of health sciences in the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, also confirmed in an email to the DCNF that there is “no relationship between the Coronavirus spike protein and HIV.” The genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV are completely different, she noted.  Claims that the two viruses are genetically linked appear to stem from a non-peer reviewed scientific paper posted on the website bioRXIV, where scientists can share their unpublished research. The paper, posted by Indian scientists, claimed to have found “uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag.” It was removed from the website after scientists debunked the research on social media, according to The Associated Press. The post’s claim that the coronavirus was genetically modified doesn’t hold up either. Experts believe it likely came from bats, with its genetic sequence sharing similarities with coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which spread from bats to civet cats to humans, according to Nature.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “There are lots of data and lots of evidence, as well as previous examples of this coming from nature,” explained Kristian Andersen, a professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, in an article published by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. “We have exactly zero evidence or data of this having any connection to a lab.” The post also appears to suggest that Dr. Anthony Fauci, a top White House coronavirus adviser and leading HIV researcher, played a role in creating the new virus. While Fauci’s name does appear on scientific patents, most of them are related to gp120, the glycoprotein HIV uses to infect other cells. There is no mention of “s-protein 120” in any of the patents. Experts have debunked the notion that the new coronavirus and HIV share the same spike glycoproteins, and there is no evidence that it was made in a lab or that Fauci was involved in its supposed creation.

Fact Check:  The viral post, shared more than 9,600 times since being posted on May 6, claims fewer than 5,000 doctors and nurses have tested positive for COVID-19. However, that figure was not accurate when it was posted, nor is it accurate now.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    More than 9,200 health care workers had tested positive by April 9, almost a month before the claim was made, according to an April 17 report from the CDC. That figure  “must be considered a lower bound because additional cases likely have gone unidentified or unreported,” according to the report. More recent data from the CDC indicates that there have been at least 67,100 cases of COVID-19 among health care personnel. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show California Department Of Social Services Letter About Coronavirus Testing) Despite the number of health care worker cases being incorrect, the Facebook post uses the figure to compare to those among workers at meat processing facilities, with the caption reading, “Don’t you find it quite interesting, that 5,000 meat packers tested positive! However, not 5,000 nurses & doctors!” That 5,000-figure for workers at meat processing facilities likely comes from a report the CDC put out in early May. It found over 4,900 cases of COVID-19 among U.S. workers in 115 meat and poultry processing facilities in 19 states.  The new coronavirus has sickened over 1.8 million people and killed some 106,000 others in the U.S. to date, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It came from a doctored video that combined audio and graphics from an MSNBC report with a clip from the “World War Z” trailer.

The bill states individuals would quarantine in their homes. Fact Check: Democratic Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush introduced H.R. 6666, also known as the Testing, Reaching, and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act on May 1.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The bill would create a $100 billion grant program “to fully mobilize coronavirus testing and contact tracking efforts” among local organizations such as community health centers and nonprofits, per a press release. It seeks to do so through funding the hiring, training and payment of individuals to run mobile testing sites and helping cover the costs of supplies for mobile testing, according to the Associated Press. Since its introduction, multiple Facebook users have claimed the bill will also “give the government the power to forcibly remove your family from your home and quarantine them.” But that is incorrect. (RELATED: Does HR 6666 Require Microchips To Be Secretly Implanted During COVID-19 Tests?) The Daily Caller searched through the bill in its entirety and found no language about forced entry into people’s homes or the removal of family members for quarantine. In fact, the bill states that grants will be distributed for “diagnostic testing for COVID-19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals and to support the quarantine of such contacts, through mobile health units and as necessary, testing individuals and providing individuals with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.” Rush also disputed the claim on his congressional website, saying, “This bill does not authorize anyone to enter your home, for whatever reason, without your permission, nor does it allow the government to remove anyone from your home because of the coronavirus.”  The TRACE Act would not require anyone to be tested for COVID-19 either, according to Rush’s website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

News outlets, including CNN and Fox News, included similar footage in its coverage of the incident. The man, Javier García, was charged with terrorism but was later found unfit to stand trial and sent for psychiatric treatment, according to the Chicago Tribune.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMelanie SnyderContributor","https://www.facebook.com/kenzi.abbott.3/posts/3449614255066725,https://www.npr.org/2020/06/01/866472832/violence-escalates-as-protests-over-george-floyd-death-continue,https://www.npr.org/2020/06/01/866472832/violence-escalates-as-protests-over-george-floyd-death-continue,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/george-floyd-investigation.html,https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/us/derek-chauvin-what-we-know-trnd/index.html,https://www.facebook.com/kenzi.abbott.3/videos/3449611808400303/,https://twitter.com/abebogale/status/1265906089368997888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fuk-factcheck-minnesota-mall-false-idUSKBN2352F3,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-minnesota-mall-false/fact-check-2019-video-of-suv-crashing-into-mall-is-falsely-linked-to-minneapolis-protests-idUSKBN2352F3?fbclid=IwAR2Q1in3vz5ug6A2u7C4XRRtIxKYFHmDGThtO9sesOz9JqSMrEHl7cVpaIc,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/30/fact-check-people-driving-stolen-children-train-minneapolis-protests-ferguson/,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/suv-drives-through-woodfield-mall-suburban-chicago-n1057151,https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/09/20/suv-drives-through-woodfield-mall-illinois-orig-lr.cnn,https://www.foxnews.com/us/terrorism-charge-suv-woodfield-mall-schaumburg-illinois,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-woodfield-mall-defendant-unfit-for-trial-20200313-s7uzo3veebfghfmd5g76mdx5e4-story.html",Viral Video Claims To Show SUV Driving Through A Minneapolis Mall During George Floyd Protests,,,,,

Facebook/Screenshot “My country Madagascar leaves all the organizations tonight and I call on other African Nations to do same,” he allegedly said.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence Rajoelina called for Madagascar or other countries to leave the WHO. The Embassy of Madagascar told the Daily Caller News Foundation the country remains a member state. Fact Check: The viral post appears to reference the WHO’s pushback on Rajoelina’s claims regarding Covid Organics, the herbal tonic Rajoelina launched in April. In a May 7 press briefing, WHO Africa Director Dr. Matshidiso Moeti said, “We would caution and advise countries against adoption of a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy,” according to France 24. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Madagascar Found A ‘Coronavirus Medicine’ That Can ‘Wipe Out The Virus’ In 6 Days)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Rajoelina has touted the tonic as a preventative and cure for COVID-19, despite no scientific evidence to show its efficacy, according to The Associated Press. Following the WHO’s caution against the use of Covid Organics, Rajoelina told France 24, “What if this remedy had been discovered by a European country, instead of Madagascar? Would people doubt it so much? I don’t think so.” There is, however, no evidence that Rajoelina has attempted to withdraw Madagascar from the WHO, nor that he encouraged other African countries to do so. The DCNF found no credible news reporting about such a call to action from Rajoelina. Searching his Twitter account and his office’s website also didn’t turn up any announcement to that effect. The island nation remains listed as one of the 194 member states on the WHO’s website. “The presidency of Madagascar formally denies all these allegations,” Lova Ranoramoro, a spokeswoman for the president, told AFP Fact Check. “Since the launch of the Covid-Organics remedy, many words have been falsely attributed to President Andry Rajoelina. We firmly condemn these false quotes.” A spokesperson for the Embassy of Madagascar in the United States confirmed to the DCNF in an email that Madagascar “is a full member of the World Health Organization and remains so.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Through a reverse image search of key frames, the Daily Caller found the video posted on Facebook in 2015, roughly four years before the coronavirus first emerged. The caption reads, “Though the idol is gone, Ganesha lives forever! And that story is the same for the true being, the soul, too. It is in this spirit and fervor that the immersion is celebrated all over India.” The video was taken on the National Highway 44 bridge that runs over the Krishna river in Beechupally, according to AFP Fact Check. Google Maps shows multiple Hindu temples located nearby. The statues appear to depict the Hindu elephant-headed god Ganesha. At the end of the 10-day festival Ganesh Chaturthi, statues of Ganesha are immersed in rivers, according to the BBC.  As of May 31, India has nearly 90,000 active coronavirus cases and over 5,100 deaths, according to the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/24hourstvchannel/videos/580306865925453/,https://www.facebook.com/24hourstvchannel/videos/580306865925453/,https://www.facebook.com/24hourstvchannel/videos/580306865925453/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/20/fact-check-india-banned-people-posting-coronavirus-social-media/,https://www.facebook.com/newschd/videos/989821804414933/?v=989821804414933,https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html,https://www.facebook.com/newschd/videos/989821804414933/?v=989821804414933,https://factcheck.afp.com/video-shows-annual-ritual-and-has-nothing-do-coronavirus,https://www.google.com/maps/place/NH+44,+India/@16.1614963,77.9350296,2517m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x398fc63ce124e255:0x94858463808bca8c!8m2!3d16.704843!4d78.0550013,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ganesha,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ganesh-Chaturthi,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKumV4ZX-V8&t=14s,https://www.mohfw.gov.in/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01757364776e73416560686d7862606d6d64732f626e6c",Does This Video Show People In India Throwing Religious Statues Into A River During The COVID-19 Pandemic?,,,,,

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The man in the video is not Bill Gates, and the video appears to be a hoax that has circulated online for years. Fact Check: Gates has become a popular target for vaccine-related misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic, The Verge reported. In this case, social media users have shared a video of a man giving the Pentagon a presentation on a proposal to “vaccinate” people against religious fanaticism. The man, purportedly Gates, goes through a slideshow on the VMAT2 gene and a “FunVax” vaccine to suppress it in the video. He concludes by saying the project has shown “great promise.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The VMAT2 gene, which stands for vesicular monoamine transporter 2, was dubbed the “God Gene” in Dr. Dean Hamer’s 2004 book “The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into Our Genes.” That book discussed how a “variation in the VMAT2 gene plays a role in one’s openness to spiritual experiences,” according to an article published in the CBE Life Science Education journal. However, the man giving the presentation in the video is not Gates, and the video appears to be a hoax that has circulated online for years. (RELATED: Has Bill Gates ‘Refused To Vaccinate His Children’?) A higher definition version of the video, titled “FunVax Lecture at the Pentagon — Must See to Believe,” can be found on YouTube, where it was uploaded in 2011. In that version, viewers can clearly see that the man doesn’t resemble Gates. A spokesperson for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation also confirmed to Reuters that it is not him. Lead Stories, a fact-checking website, reported that the video appeared to be a promotion for a “faux documentary.” The creator had a Kickstarter campaign seeking funds for investigating the “truth behind the Vaccine Against Religious Fundamentalism” and trailer for the alleged vaccine, per Lead Stories.  The video appears on numerous fringe websites, often under tags such as “chem trails,” “eugenics” and “Pentagon bioweapon to destroy religion,” according to Vice.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The Facebook post features a screen grab of an article, which put up the headline “We Lost N700 billion Naira COVID-19 Relief Funds Due To Fire Outbreak – Finance Minister.” The text below a photo of Nigerian Finance Minister Zainab Ahmed claims she “announced to the nation that the government lost 700billion naira Covid-19 Relief Funds.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Treasury House, which houses the Office of the Accountant General, caught fire in the Nigerian capital city of Abuja in early April, according to The Guardian. Igbo Watch and News Mirror, two Nigerian media outlets, reported that 700 billion naira had been lost in the blaze, citing an alleged statement from Ahmed. However, the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning refuted the claim in a tweet that included the same screen grab with the words “FAKE NEWS” superimposed over it.

The state allows funeral services with limited visitors. Fact Check: COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has claimed the lives of over 29,000 people in New York to date, according to The New York Times. (RELATED: Is Dunkin’ Donuts Closing All Locations Over Coronavirus Concerns?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which features a photo of COVID-19 victims in a refrigerated truck, claims that the bodies of COVID-19 victims in New York become property of the state and are incinerated with no “wakes or memorial services.” BuzzFeed News published the photo after obtaining it from an emergency room nurse in New York City. “New York Coronavirus Victims,” reads the Facebook post’s caption. “They’re not letting you bury your own. There will be no wakes or memorial services to pay your last respects. Every contaminated corpse belongs to the state and will be exposed of in an incinerator.” There is, however, no evidence to corroborate the post’s claim. No such policy appears in any of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s executive orders, and the New York State Assembly website shows no laws mandating such actions. “NOTHING stating the State owns any body and will incinerate it upon verification of being infected with Covid-19,” Scott Schmidt, president of the New York State Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners, told FactCheck.org. “Funeral directors, Coroners and Medical Examiners have been briefed on proper handling procedures for such cases as have Cemetery and Crematory Operators.”  Aja Worthy-Davis, a spokeswoman for the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, also told FactCheck.org that the claim is “ridiculous.” New York City’s government explicitly states on its website that funeral services are allowed. Jeffrey Hammond, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Health, confirmed to the Daily Caller that “funeral homes may continue to operate and hold services.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “However, they should postpone services when possible,” Hammond said in an email. “If services must be held, funeral homes should limit the size of any services or gatherings to as few participants as possible (e.g. immediate family).” Some funeral homes have offered live streaming and video conferencing to those beyond immediate family to partake remotely, according to Gothamist.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=299910377645894&set=a.111884009781866&type=3&theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-live-updates.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/18/fact-check-dunkin-donuts-closing-locations-coronavirus/,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/miriamelder/coronavirus-new-york-city-hospital-nurse-covid-19-deaths,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=299910377645894&set=a.111884009781866&type=3&theater,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/miriamelder/coronavirus-new-york-city-hospital-nurse-covid-19-deathshttps://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/miriamelder/coronavirus-new-york-city-hospital-nurse-covid-19-deaths,https://www.governor.ny.gov/executive-orders,http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO:http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO:,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/misinformation-on-covid-19-death-protocols-in-new-york/?fbclid=IwAR1cCZ-MFf2ZLBo_rJpXNK5rQSU26AKCx9oPK5GiV00oDAa4I55oR3kH2LQ,https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/misinformation-on-covid-19-death-protocols-in-new-york/?fbclid=IwAR1cCZ-MFf2ZLBo_rJpXNK5rQSU26AKCx9oPK5GiV00oDAa4I55oR3kH2LQ,https://www1.nyc.gov/site/helpnownyc/get-help/funeral-burial-guidance.page,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-hammond-a6556036,https://gothamist.com/news/funeral-homes-are-facing-unprecedented-demand-amid-coronavirus-pandemic,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#43373126352c310327222a2f3a20222f2f26316d202c2e","Viral Image Claims Bodies Infected With COVID-19 In New York Become Property Of State, Get Incinerated",,,,,

The viral image claims, using what appears to be a screen grab of the Wikipedia page for the CARES Act, that the relief package was introduced in January 2017. It further claims that the supposed introduction date suggests the coronavirus pandemic is a “PLAN-DEMIC.” “Clearly a PLAN – DEMIC…Guess what they have planned next for you,” reads the accompanying caption. “Hint – None of it is in your best interest. Hint 2 – It’s much worse than you could ever imagine.” However, the post contains inaccurate information, and it lacks important context for the CARES Act, also known as H.R. 748. (RELATED: Did PBS Donate $25 Million To The Democratic National Committee?)  The original H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act, was introduced by Democratic Connecticut Rep. Joe Courtney on Jan. 24, 2019. It was passed by the House on July 17, 2019, but never made it to vote in the Senate. Because the Constitution requires all bills involving raising revenue to originate in the House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced on March 25 the CARES Act as a substitute amendment to H.R. 748, completely replacing the original language. Such a move is a “commonly used workaround,” Gregory Koger, a University of Miami political scientist, told PolitiFact.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The CARES Act passed the Senate 96-0, and the House then agreed to the amendment of the bill via voice vote on March 27, according to Congress.gov. Trump signed it later that day. While the original bill was introduced in January 2019, the CARES Act language was not added until March 2020. No part of the bill was introduced in 2017. We rate this claim false.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

He was actually speaking about the economic benefits of global vaccination efforts. Fact Check: Gates and his wife chair the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which, among other things, has committed billions of dollars to the research, development and delivery of vaccines. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show ‘Center For Global Human Population Reduction’ Sign At Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation Headquarters)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A Facebook user recently shared a YouTube video, titled “Bill Gates admits on CNBC TV he’s making 200 BILLION US$ on his Vaccinations,” that shows a 25-second clip from a January 2019 interview Gates did with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In response to a question about the return on his foundation’s $10 billion investment in vaccines, Gates appears to say, “Over a twenty-to-one return, so if you just looked at the economic benefits that’s a pretty strong number compared to anything else.” “Take the numbers that you ran through for if you had put that money into an S&P 500 and reinvested the dividends, you come up with something like $17 billion, but you think it’s $200 billion,” CNBC’s Becky Quick then says to Gates in the video. It abruptly ends after Gates responds, “Here, yeah.”  The Daily Caller reviewed the interview in its entirety and found the YouTube clip has been deceptively edited. Parts of the interview appear to have spliced together, removing key context surrounding Gates’ comments. At no point does he claim to have made $200 billion in profits from his foundation’s vaccination efforts. “It’s been $100 billion overall that the world’s put in, our foundation is a bit more than $10 billion, and we feel there’s been over a 20-to-one return,” Gates actually said. “So if you just look at the economic benefits that’s a pretty strong number compared to anything else. The human benefit in millions of lives saved.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The $200 billion-figure Quick mentions actually comes from the Copenhagen Consensus Center, a think tank that analyses comparative strategies in fighting poverty. Gates used the Copenhagen Consensus Center’s estimate in a January 2019 Wall Street Journal op-ed to compare the impact of his foundation’s $10 billion investment to the hypothetical impact on developing countries had he instead invested in other sectors, such as energy or infrastructure. “By investing in global health institutions, however, we exceed all those returns: The $10 billion that we gave to help provide vaccines, drugs, bed nets and other supplies in developing countries created an estimated $200 billion in social and economic benefits,” Gates wrote.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/kimberly.gibson.7334/posts/10222375272436909,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Vaccine-Development-and-Surveillance/Strategy-Leadership,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2010/01/Bill-and-Melinda-Gates-Pledge-%2410-Billion-in-Call-for-Decade-of-Vaccines,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/04/fact-check-image-center-global-human-population-reduction-sign-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-headquarters/,https://www.facebook.com/kimberly.gibson.7334/posts/10222375272436909,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/01/23/bill-gates-and-the-return-on-investment-in-vaccinations-davos.html,https://www.facebook.com/kimberly.gibson.7334/posts/10222375272436909,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/01/23/bill-gates-and-the-return-on-investment-in-vaccinations-davos.html,https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/01/23/bill-gates-and-the-return-on-investment-in-vaccinations-davos.html,https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-the-best-investment-ive-ever-made-11547683309?mod=e2tw,https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-the-best-investment-ive-ever-made-11547683309?mod=e2tw,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#196d6b7c6f766b597d787075607a7875757c6b377a7674",Did Bill Gates Admit To Profiting $200 Billion From Vaccines?,,,,,

Fact Check: Dangote, the founder and chair of industrial firm Dangote Group, has donated 1 billion naira (about $2.6 million) to support the Nigerian government in curbing the spread of the new coronavirus, CNN reported. He is the richest man in Africa, with an estimated net worth of $8.3 billion as of press time, according to Forbes.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post claims that Dangote has further pledged to provide all Nigerian citizens with weekly 20,000 naira allowances, saying, “Aliko Dangote is set to put a smile on every Nigerian citizens face. He wants to do what federal government failed to do!” It urges users to “click to apply” without providing a link. Had he done so, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it, and the Aliko Dangote Foundation has not put out a press release. The Dangote Group also refuted the claim in an April 15 Facebook post.  “We have been alerted of a scam purportedly sanctioned by Aliko Dangote Foundation and claiming to pay people a weekly allowance of N20,000,” reads the statement. “This malicious act aimed at defrauding unsuspecting victims is currently being perpetuated through several channels including WhatsApp, emails, sms, and dedicated website.”  While the Nigerian government doesn’t appear to have promised weekly allowances to its citizens, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari did announce on March 29 that conditional cash transfers would be paid to the “most vulnerable” for two months. Roughly 148,000 people received such payments between April 8 and April 14, according to the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs. As of press time, Nigeria has reported 9,800 coronavirus cases and some 270 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/nuhu.suhnunbagwai/posts/831599060666512,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/africa/coronavirus-nigeria-fund/index.html,https://www.forbes.com/profile/aliko-dangote/#4e87bebe22fc,https://www.facebook.com/nuhu.suhnunbagwai/posts/831599060666512,https://www.dangote.com/foundation/,https://www.facebook.com/dangotegroup/photos/a.287045337993805/3148471778517799/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/dangotegroup/photos/a.287045337993805/3148471778517799/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/MBuhari/status/1244327790440316930,https://twitter.com/FMHDSD/status/1250082991742820352,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#14606671627b665470757d786d7775787871663a777b79",Is Nigerian Billionaire Aliko Dangote Giving Weekly Allowances To All Nigerian Citizens?,,,,,

The photo has been digitally altered to remove two additional people. Fact Check: Located at the center of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the Kaaba is considered the holiest building in Islam. Muslims are religiously expected to make the Hajj, a pilgrimage to the Kaaba that occurs annually, at least once in their life if they are able.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post features an image of a lone individual, who allegedly is the only one allowed to be there, praying near the Kaaba, with the caption claiming, “The only person allowed to sit here!! He is a cleaner, not a king, not a minister, neither a Prince.. Allah chose him over the others.” Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the image has been digitally manipulated. In the original picture, taken by photographer Amr Nabil for The Associated Press, two additional people stand beside the barrier around the Kaaba. They have been digitally removed from the photo being shared on social media. (RELATED: Has Poland Refused To Allow The Building Of Mosques?) The person the Facebook post identifies as a cleaner is actually a police officer, according to The Associated Press’ caption. It reads, “A Saudi policeman prays in front of the Kaaba, the cubic building at the Grand Mosque, in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, Saturday, March 7, 2020. Saudi Arabia emptied Islam’s holiest site for what they say sterilization over fears of the new coronavirus.” On March 5, the Saudi government closed the Grand Mosque for cleaning in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, according to Business Insider. The area around the Kaaba reopened March 7 with new safety precautions to those not performing the Umrah, a voluntary pilgrimage to Mecca. Beginning March 20, the government suspended daily and weekly prayers at the Grand Mosque, according to Al Jazeera.  Despite thousands of mosques reopening in Saudi Arabia on May 31, the Grand Mosque remains closed to the public, per the Washington Post.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/YDAPAKISTANOFFICIAL/photos/a.251705755688857/634108154115280/?type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kaaba-shrine-Mecca-Saudi-Arabia,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/muslims/themes/beliefs.html,https://www.facebook.com/YDAPAKISTANOFFICIAL/photos/a.251705755688857/634108154115280/?type=3&theater,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Virus-Outbreak-Mideast-Saudi-Arabia/13190f76996740fc801878dbebc37843/13/0,https://www.facebook.com/YDAPAKISTANOFFICIAL/photos/a.251705755688857/634108154115280/?type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/01/20/fact-check-jamkaran-mosque-metro-red-flag-first-time/,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Virus-Outbreak-Mideast-Saudi-Arabia/13190f76996740fc801878dbebc37843/13/0,https://www.businessinsider.com/these-photos-show-how-coronavirus-fears-left-religious-sites-empty-2020-3,https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewstory.php?lang=en&newsid=2043849,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/saudi-arabia-bans-prayers-holy-mosques-coronavirus-fears-200320063001931.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/mosques-reopen-in-saudi-arabia-and-jerusalem-amid-virus-woes/2020/05/31/34138458-a30b-11ea-be06-af5514ee0385_story.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2f5b5d4a59405d6f4b4e4643564c4e43434a5d014c4042",Image Claims To Show Cleaner Praying At Mecca’s Kaaba During The Coronavirus Pandemic,,,,,

Fact Check:  Protests erupted in Minneapolis and other major U.S. cities after Floyd died while in police custody. In a video of Floyd’s arrest, a Minneapolis police officer, identified as Derek Chauvin, can be seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck, despite Floyd repeatedly saying he couldn’t breathe, according to The New York Times. Chauvin was arrested on murder charges Friday.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In Washington, D.C., hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House, which the Secret Service briefly put under lockdown on Friday night, The Hill reported. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show People Driving A Stolen Children’s Train During Minneapolis Protests) The viral Facebook video claims to show protesters gaining access to the White House grounds and damaging the building, with the caption reading, “Protesters break into THE WHITE HOUSE.” That is incorrect, however. The video actually shows the Ohio Statehouse, where protesters broke windows early Friday. Reuters and WLWT, a Cincinnati-based NBC affiliate, posted videos of the protests at the Statehouse from different angles on their respective YouTube pages. “Of those on the [statehouse] grounds, a few began to commit acts of vandalism, damaging some windows, light fixtures and doors,” Staff Lt. Craig Cvetan, the public affairs commander for Ohio State Highway Patrol, told Newsweek. “One protester was able to gain access to the Statehouse through a broken window to an office; however, the protester fled back out the window before troopers could apprehend him from the interior. He was taken into custody by Columbus police when he exited the window.”  The Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board, which maintains the Ohio Statehouse, said in a press release that 28 windows, 5 exterior light poles and several flags sustained damage.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The photo of the bill appears on a fundraising page to cover the hospital bills for someone diagnosed with tuberculosis and severe aplastic anemia. Fact Check: The Facebook post features a photo of a Singapore General Hospital medical bill sent to a patient on Feb. 27. Though a notice on the document states that it is not the final bill, the listed charges add up to over 180,000 Singapore dollars, equal to roughly $128,000.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “SGH Hospital Bill For COVID-19 Patient 18 Days Stay. Total bil (sic) amount SD180,143.00. No joke,” the caption reads. “Pls Stay at Home & Stay Safe.” (RELATED: Does This Video Show Defective Medical Gowns Made In China?) The bill, however, does not belong to a COVID-19 patient. Singapore General Hospital refuted the claim in a Facebook post in April.  “It has been brought to our attention that a hospital bill (case number: xxxxxxx469H) dated 27 Feb 2020 belonging to one of our patients has resurfaced and is circulating on social media and text message platforms,” Singapore General Hospital wrote. “There was claim that the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. This is not true.”  Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found the photo of the hospital bill in a GIVE.Asia fundraising campaign set up by a man identified as Gan Chang. That fundraiser was for his wife, who was hospitalized for severe aplastic anemia, tuberculosis and pneumonia, according to the GIVE.Asia fundraiser page. His wife’s name matches that on the invoice in the Facebook post. The Singaporean government pays the hospital bills incurred by Singapore residents and “long term pass holders” admitted to public hospitals for COVID-19, except in cases where the individuals disregarded travel advisories, according to the Singapore Ministry of Health website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207214091227424&set=a.2847797770889&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10207214091227424&set=a.2847797770889&type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/29/fact-check-video-defective-medical-gowns-made-china/,https://www.facebook.com/SingaporeGeneralHospital/posts/10156888279996681,https://www.facebook.com/SingaporeGeneralHospital/posts/10156888279996681,https://give.asia/campaign/help-my-wife-fight-for-her-life-in-icu#/,https://give.asia/campaign/help-my-wife-fight-for-her-life-in-icu#/,https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/covid-19-pay-101801737.html,https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/tighter-measures-to-minimise-further-spread-of-covid-19,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3878196859c81b397929a9f8a90929f9f9681dd909c9e",Viral Image Claims To Show Singapore Hospital Bill Sent To COVID-19 Patient,,,,,

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  There is no evidence that Trump re-signed such a law. The article was originally published on a satire website. Fact Check:  The internet is replete with misinformation about politicians, with this particular post alleging Trump made many “Muslamic laws” illegal. (RELATED: ‘Down With The USA’ – Meme Purportedly Shows Anti-American Protesters In Michigan) The post links to an article, which put up the headline “President Trump Re-Signs 1952 Law Making Muslamic Law Illegal Again,” that was published on the website USA News earlier this month. It claims Trump recently “re-signed Senator McCarthy’s landmark law making any kind of Muslamic law illegal in the United States.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    That appears to be a reference to the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act. Also known as the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the law “upheld the national origins quota system established by the Immigration Act of 1924,” according to the Office of the Historian at the State Department. Some social media users have also falsely claimed the act banned Muslims from coming to America or running for public office, but the words “Islam” and “Muslim” never appear in the act’s text. Had Trump re-signed legislation to make “Muslamic law” illegal, it would have been picked up by major news outlets, yet none have reported on it, and there is no record of such a law in the Library of Congress. The article appears to have copied nearly word-for-word from an article on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” Yet, while Bustatroll’s article clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, the USA News article does not, portraying it as real.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley want the Bible to be deemed hate speech. Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  None of the congresswomen have called for such a measure. The article was originally published on a satire website. Fact Check: Omar and Tlaib are two of three Muslims serving in Congress. Pressley, who represents Massachusetts’s 7th congressional district, is the first black woman to represent her state in Congress, and Ocasio-Cortez is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. All four, sometimes referred to as the so-called “squad,” are members of the Progressive Caucus. The May 1 article, titled “The Squad Wants Bible Deemed To Be ‘Hate Speech'” claims the four congresswomen want the Bible declared as hate speech, as well as censored or banned. (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Tweet About Electric Cars During Hurricane Dorian?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    It contains alleged comments from the four congresswomen: Ocasio-Cortez is quoted as saying, “It promotes slavery, sexual assault, and murder,” while Tlaib and Omar supposedly called the Bible “racist” and “vile,” respectively. Pressley is credited with saying, “I agree with them.” None of these remarks appear to be real, however. Nor is there any evidence the four congresswomen ever called for deeming the Bible as hate speech. Searching their social media accounts turned up no calls for such a measure. Nothing to that effect appears on their official websites. The article appears to lift nearly word-for-word from an article published on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” Despite the satirical nature of the content, some social media users perceived it as real because other websites failed to disclaim its origins.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/groups/ArmeniansForTrump/permalink/1553100381523762/,https://www.pewforum.org/2019/01/03/faith-on-the-hill-116/,https://theslot.jezebel.com/meet-the-crew-1830405936,https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/08/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-cant-afford-to-rent-an-apartment-in-dc.html,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/15/politics/who-are-the-squad/index.html,https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=71&sectiontree=2,71,https://news.goproarticles.com/2020/05/01/the-squad-wants-bible-deemed-to-be-hate-speech/?fbclid=IwAR0FD1OL-pelsgxC7339jpcitWi2DoFaRaoJIX98Q6x7_5BroHR-qok-mxQ,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/06/fact-check-ocasio-cortez-tweet-electric-cars-hurricane-dorian/,https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03iTQpYIL3VoEZbDTOUsrUjbt4ZRA%3A1590793384323&ei=qJTRXq-cE7fAytMPyPqcgAs&q=bible+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FOcasioCortez%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FrepAOC%2F+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRashidaForCongress%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRepRashida%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FIlhanMN%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRepIlhan%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fayannapressley2%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRepAyannaPressley%2F&oq=bible+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FOcasioCortez%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FrepAOC%2F+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRashidaForCongress%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRepRashida%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FIlhanMN%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRepIlhan%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fayannapressley2%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRepAyannaPressley%2F&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1DwokBY7KpLYJjDS2gAcAB4AIABQIgBbZIBATKYATCgAQGgAQKqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwivkNWUl9rpAhU3oHIEHUg9B7AQ4dUDCAw&uact=5,https://twitter.com/search?q=Bible%20(from%3AAOC%20OR%20from%3ARepAOC%20OR%20from%3ARashidaTlaib%20OR%20from%3ARepRashida%20OR%20from%3AIlhanMN%20OR%20from%3AIlhan%20OR%20from%3AAyannaPressley%20OR%20from%3ARepPressley)&src=typed_query,https://www.google.com/search?q=Bible+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Faoc%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frepaoc%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frashidatlaib%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Freprashida%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Filhanmn%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frepilhan%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fayannapressley%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frepayannapressley%2F&oq=Bible+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Faoc%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frepaoc%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frashidatlaib%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Freprashida%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Filhanmn%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frepilhan%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fayannapressley%2F+OR+site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Frepayannapressley%2F&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.751j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://pressley.house.gov/search/node/bible,https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/search/node/Bible,https://tlaib.house.gov/search/node/Bible,https://omar.house.gov/search/node/Bible,https://bustatroll.org/2019/10/23/the-squad-wants-bible-deemed-to-be-hate-speech/?fbclid=IwAR0GlrSUI8abpLh2Rk68wynftgDrpu7LMokS0Dm9zy8IdM8EQjNcN-TNFv8,https://bustatroll.org/about-us/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#285c5a4d5e475a684c494144514b4944444d5a064b4745",Does The ‘Squad’ Want The Bible To Be Deemed Hate Speech?,,,,,

There is no evidence that Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and billionaire George Soros want to implant microchips in people via coronavirus testing. Fact Check: The image includes a diagram of the nasopharyngeal swabbing procedure used to collect samples in some forms of COVID-19 testing. An arrow pointing toward the end of the swab says, “Insert microchip here.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “This is what Bill Gates and George Soros want to do…. Secretly stick you with a chip while testing you for the corona virus,” reads the caption. “The Dems have a bill on the house floor ready to vote on it to require this…. House Bill 6666…. no bull…. look it up and wake up!” H.R. 6666, also known as the Testing, Reaching and Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, was introduced by Democratic Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush on May 1. The bill seeks to “authorize the secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes,” according to its text. There is, however, no mention of microchips or implants in the text of the bill. There is also no evidence that Gates or Soros want to microchip people through COVID-19 testing. Similar claims about Gates have been debunked by other fact-checkers. (RELATED: Did The Italian Parliament Call For The Arrest Of Bill Gates?) No action has been taken on H.R. 6666, which has been the subject of other dubious claims, since its introduction.

At no point did he suggest a COVID-19 vaccine might kill nearly 1 million people. Fact Check: The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which, among other things, promotes access to vaccinations around the world, has committed $300 million to help fund the development of coronavirus detection, treatments and vaccines. Such efforts appear to have made Gates a popular target for misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic, with this particular article claiming, “WATCH: Bill Gates Admits His COVID-19 Vaccine Might KILL Nearly 1,000,000 People.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The article, which was filed under the “conspiracy” section of the Clover Chronicle website, links to an interview Gates did with CNBC in early April about the work he and his foundation are doing to fight the pandemic. During the interview, he discusses the difficulties of quickly developing a COVID-19 vaccine that will be effective for the elderly in the context of side effects. “Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects,” Gates said. “If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more — 700,000 people who will suffer from that.” He added that “understanding the safety at gigantic scales across all age ranges — pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities — it’s very, very hard,” according to the CNBC video. (RELATED: Has Bill Gates ‘Refused To Vaccinate His Children’?) At no point in the segment linked in the article or the rest of the interview does Gates suggest the vaccine might kill nearly 1 million people. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence Gates has suggested such a thing elsewhere.  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to a request for comment.

Fact Check: Protests broke out in Minneapolis and other parts of the country this week after George Floyd died while in police custody. Video showed a Minneapolis police officer, who has been identified as Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for several minutes during the arrest, despite Floyd repeatedly saying he couldn’t breathe, according to the Chicago Tribune.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Social media users have shared the photo of people driving the children’s train in recent days, claiming, “Looters have stolen the children’s train out of the #Minneapolis and their (sic) driving down the street shouting Choo Choo.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Former Minneapolis Cop Derek Chauvin At A Trump Rally?) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered the photo is not from protests in Minneapolis, however. The picture, taken by Reuters photographer Mario Anzuoni, comes from August 2014 protests following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, according to its caption. “People ride a small train-shaped vehicle during a peaceful demonstration, as communities react to the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri August 14, 2014,” reads the caption. “Missouri’s governor Jay Nixon moved on Thursday to calm days of racially charged protests over the police shooting of Brown, an unarmed black teenager, naming the African-American captain of the Highway Patrol Ron Johnson to oversee security in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson.” At the time, journalists covering the Ferguson protests posted pictures and videos of the train, purportedly playing music, as it drove down the street, according to BuzzFeed News.  NBC News reported Hennepin County prosecutor Mike Freeman announced that Chauvin, who was fired along with three other officers involved in Floyd’s arrest, was arrested on Friday and charged 3rd degree murder and manslaughter.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Public health agencies, including the Italian Ministry of Health, say COVID-19 is caused by a virus, not a bacterium. Viral infections are typically treated with antiviral drugs. Fact Check: The viral post claims that Italian doctors have discovered by going “against the World Health Organization’s ‘law’ that no bodies receive autopsies” that the coronavirus is “not a virus, but a bacterium.” It further claims COVID-19 can be “easily treated with aspirin and coagulant.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Italian medical experts did find in an autopsy-based study, which has not been peer-reviewed, that COVID-19 can cause blood clots that damage the lungs. However, they refer to COVID-19 as an “outbreak caused by a new coronavirus infection,” not a bacterial infection. The Italian Ministry of Health continues to refer to coronavirus as a virus on its website. So do the World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (RELATED: Were Thousands Of Birds Killed By Coronavirus Or 5G Networks In Italy?) The WHO does not have a rule against conducting autopsies on bodies infected with COVID-19. In March, it actually issued guidance on how to perform such autopsies safely. The post’s claim that aspirin and coagulants can “easily” treat the virus doesn’t hold up either. Viral infections require either vaccinations to prevent them or antiviral drugs to treat them, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, according to the WHO.  “Clotting is triggered by many illnesses,” Agnes Lee, medical director of the Thrombosis Program at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, told The Associated Press. “We do not use aspirin or anticoagulants to treat infection. That’s not the use for these medications.” It’s worth noting that anticoagulants — not coagulants — are used to help prevent blood clots, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Coagulants promote blood clotting.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The post further undermines its credibility by making unfounded claims related to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and the WHO, saying Italy is “demanding Bill Gates and the World Health organization be held accountable for ‘crimes against humanity.'” The Daily Caller News Foundation recently debunked the claim that the Italian Parliament called for Gates’s arrest, and there is no evidence it has made such a demand about the WHO.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  There is no evidence that Trump has made such an order. The original publisher retracted the story because it was deemed “unreliable.” Fact Check: The U.S. government operates a naval base and detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which has been used to hold at least 780 detainees since 2002, according to the New York Times. The Facebook post links to a May 22 article, titled “Trump Orders Guantanamo Get Ready For ‘High Level’ Prisoners,” that was posted on the website All Major Seven Subjects. It claims American politicians will be among the “high level” prisoners.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But there is no evidence Trump has ordered American politicians be sent to Guantanamo Bay prison. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting to corroborate the claim, and the article fails to provide credible sourcing to support it. (RELATED: Is Pennsylvania Fining And Jailing People For Not Wearing Masks In Public?) The article cites the deployment of an Arizona National Guard unit to the base for nine months as evidence of coming detainees. Based on those details, the deployment appears to have occurred in 2018, when a unit of nearly 50 Arizona National Guard military police deployed there to support Operation Enduring Freedom, according to Fox 10 Phoenix. That indicates the claim has been circulating for roughly two years. The fact-checking website Lead Stories reported that the claim originated in an article published on NewsPunch, which previously went by YourNewsWire, in January 2018. NewsPunch retracted the story, but other websites lifted and further expanded it before that, according to Lead Stories. “When I closed YourNewsWire down in late 2019 and moved to NewsPunch, the focus on what we would cover editorially changed and it was decided that we would no longer cover unreliable conspiracies whilst also being much more responsible in fact-checking content before publishing,” NewsPunch Editor-in-Chief Sean Adl-Tabatabai told Lead Stories. “This shift in our editorial standards meant that old, outdated conspiratorial content like this no longer had a place on the website. This was one of many articles that got deleted after making the move, primarily due to the fact that the source of the information (Sorcha Faal) is somebody I now consider unreliable.”  It’s also worth noting that Jonathan Hafetz, a professor at Seton Hall Law School who has represented numerous Guantanamo prisoners in federal court, told CNN in 2016 that to “bring anyone from the US – citizen or not – to Guantanamo and put them in military detention would be unprecedented.” The DCNF found no evidence to corroborate the claim that Trump recently ordered American politicians and other “high level” prisoners be sent to Guantanamo Bay prison, and the original publisher retracted the article because it was deemed “unreliable.” We rate the claim false.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Neither the tribunal nor the document is real. The people and organizations mentioned have not been charged with war crimes. Fact Check: At first glance, the document appears authentic. The letterhead includes two official-looking seals, while also claiming to be from the “Human Rights Tribunal International” of the U.S. government. It alleges to be a notice of acknowledgment for documents filed related to “the matter of The Government of The United States v Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, Anthony Fauci, Christine Grady, Tedros Adhanom, National Governors Association, CDC, WHO, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.” It later states the case involves alleged “war crimes with intent to commit mass genocide.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, a closer inspection of the document reveals that it is not genuine. The U.S. does not have such a tribunal, and the notice uses language atypical of legal documents such as “49th Day, Year of Yahweh, 6022” for the date. The notice also provides two dubious websites to access the alleged case documents: reignoftheheavens.com and humanrightstribunal.international. The latter website, which is insecure, explains on one page that “the present Human Rights Tribunal started within the Reign of the Heavens before it was placed in trust,” further adding to its dubiousness. Had any of the people or organizations been charged with war crimes, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet no reporting could be found. (RELATED: Is Bill Gates ‘Advocating For Church Gatherings To Never Return’?) A number of the defendants listed in the fake tribunal case have been the subject of unfounded claims related to the coronavirus pandemic.

Fact Check: The Australian $10 banknote, pictured in the Facebook post, features a golden circular illustration and an image of someone sitting at a desk. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) first issued this design in 2017, according to the RBA website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The post alleges that the person is Gates and that the circular illustration is the coronavirus, saying, “What’s bill gates and the Corona virus (sic) doing on Australian 10 dollar note. And many will just blow this off.. Wake up, it’s been planned for years.” But that isn’t correct. Per the RBA website, the person depicted on the banknote is Gilmore, an Australian writer who lived from 1865 to 1962. The RBA explains that the representation is “based on a 1952 photograph sourced from the Herald and Weekly Times Limited portrait collection, Pictures Collection, State Library of Victoria.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Tom Hanks Quarantined In Australia With Wilson The Volleyball?) The circular illustration does not represent the coronavirus. Rather, it is the banknote designer’s interpretation of the bramble wattle, a plant native to Australia, according to the RBA website.

Gretchen Whitmer violating social distancing guidelines on Michigan’s Mackinac Island.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The photo, which is well over a year old, does not show Whitmer violating social distancing guidelines. Fact Check: In recent days, social media users have shared a photo of Whitmer speaking with two men, claiming it shows the governor violating social distancing guidelines on Mackinac Island, where the governor’s summer residence is located.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Happy Memorial Weekend Look at #whitmer, obviously the 6ft rule is funny because you can see her smile without her mask on!” reads the caption. “Nice #Michigan Keep staying home….. NOT!” The photo, however, predates the confirmation of Michigan’s first coronavirus cases by well over a year and does not show her breaking social distancing guidelines. In October 2018, the Oakland Press included the photo in a question-and-answer article with the then-gubernatorial candidate. It shows Whitmer “speaking to Michigan residents while on the campaign trail,” according to the caption. In an email to the Daily Caller, a spokesperson for Whitmer’s office said the Michigan governor has not been to her Mackinac Island residence since September 2019. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Michigan Gov Gretchen Whitmer Violating Social Distancing Rules For A Beer Tasting?) Whitmer announced on May 22 that the state’s stay-at-home order would be extended to June 12. The announcement came after she relaxed some restrictions, permitting social gatherings of 10 or fewer people and allowing some retail businesses to operate on an appointment-only basis, according to the Detroit Free Press.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Part of the alleged speech has previously been misattributed to late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Fact Check:  Social media platforms are replete with statements attributed to billionaires such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and George Soros. (RELATED: Did Bill Gates Say, ‘Be Nice To Nerds, Chances Are You’ll End Up Working For One’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular Facebook post credits Gouves, purportedly a billionaire worth $7 billion, with a deathbed speech that includes “five undeniable facts” that he learned during his lifetime. Some iterations of the post include an alleged picture of the billionaire. “At this moment, lying on the bed, sick and remembering all my life, I realize that all my recognition and wealth that I have is meaningless in the face of imminent death,” he allegedly said. “You can hire someone to drive a car for you, make money for you – but you can not rent someone to carry the disease for you.” Gouves does not appear to be a real person, however. Forbes and Bloomberg, outlets that closely track the net worths of ultra-wealthy individuals, have not included him on their respective billionaire lists. The only time a media outlet seems to have mentioned Gouves is to debunk his existence. Snopes reported that a similar deathbed speech has been misattributed to Jobs, the late co-founder of Apple, since at least December 2015. In January 2019, a variation of it resurfaced attached to Gouves, whose name closely resembles that of Jobs, according to Snopes. The latter half of the supposed speech has been circulating online, without attribution, since at least September 2015, when it appeared on a Chinese blog.  The man pictured in some iterations of the post is James Kiroauc, a “Certified Dedicated Level 2 Quantum Healing Hypnosis Technique Practitioner” based out of Calgary, Canada, per his website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Facebook posts in recent days have claimed Chauvin is pictured onstage among other police officers wearing “Cops for Trump” shirts at Trump’s October 2019 campaign rally in Minneapolis. Some posts utilize large arrows to point out who they claim is Chauvin, while others circle the individual. “This guy is the Minneapolis cop, officer Derek Chauvin, whose photo shows him kneeling on the neck of a black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis, killing him,” read one now-deleted post. “Feel free to share the hell out of it.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Former Minneapolis Cop Derek Chauvin Wearing A ‘Make Whites Great Again’ Hat?) Chauvin and three other Minneapolis police officers were fired after video emerged that showed Chauvin kneeling on the neck of a black man during an arrest, even after the man, George Floyd, repeatedly said he couldn’t breathe, USA Today reported. Floyd later died at the hospital. Minneapolis Police Officers Federation President Lt. Bob Kroll told The Associated Press that “none of the officers in the incident were near the Trump rally.” He said the man, whom social media users have misidentified, is Gallagher, the president of the Bloomington Police Officers Federation, according to The Associated Press.

Dianne Feinstein said, “One day the American people will know their place, and they will stop thinking they deserve the same privileges as us.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The Daily Caller didn’t find any record of Feinstein saying the quote. Fact Check: Feinstein has been a vocal proponent of gun control. For instance, she was the architect behind the now-expired Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 that prohibited the manufacture of certain semi-automatic firearms and limited magazines to 10 rounds. She and other Democrats also introduced an updated version of the bill in 2019.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The California senator did once possess a permit to carry a concealed weapon but, per a spokesman from her office in 2012, she dropped the permit, according to The Hill. (RELATED: Did Democrats Introduce A Bill To ‘Euthanize Seniors’ To Save Social Security?) The viral Facebook post alleges Feinstein made the comment while talking about her concealed carry permit. There is, however, no record of her saying, “One day the American people will know their place, and they will stop thinking they deserve the same privileges as us.” Searching resources like her congressional website and the congressional record turned up no matching or similar statements. It appears on neither her social media nor ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets. Media outlets have also not attributed the quote to her. This isn’t the first time a fake quote has been attributed to Feinstein. In May 2019, a meme falsely quoted her as saying, “When the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in … that’s just human nature.”  Feinstein’s office did not respond to requests for comment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=236349184277819&id=100037082173836,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-103hr3355enr/pdf/BILLS-103hr3355enr.pdf,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/12/17/everything-you-need-to-know-about-banning-assault-weapons-in-one-post/,https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=EFC76859-879D-4038-97DD-C577212ED17B,https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/273989-feinstein-doesnt-have-concealed-carry-permit-anymore,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/25/fact-check-democrats-introduce-bill-euthanize-seniors-social-security/,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=236349184277819&id=100037082173836,https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/search?p=search&q=%22One+day+the+American+people+will+know+their+place%2C+and+they+will+stop+thinking+they+deserve+the+same+privileges+as+us%22,https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22:%22congrecord%22,%22search%22:%22%5C%22stop%20thinking%20they%20deserve%20the%20same%20privileges%20as%20us%5C%22%22%7D&searchResultViewType=expanded&KWICView=false,https://www.facebook.com/pg/SenatorFeinstein/posts/?ref=page_internal,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22One%20day%20the%20American%20people%22%20(from%3ASenFeinstein%20OR%20from%3ADianneFeinstein)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/SenFeinstein,https://news.google.com/search?q=%22One%20day%20the%20American%20people%20will%20know%20their%20place%2C%20and%20they%20will%20stop%20thinking%20they%20deserve%20the%20same%20privileges%20as%20us%22&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/05/31/fact-check-dianne-feinstein-gunman-lay-down-weapons-human-nature/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#05717760736a774561646c697c6664696960772b666a68","Did Dianne Feinstein Say, ‘One Day The American People Will Know Their Place’?",,,,,

Mike DeWine authorized the release of 4,300 inmates on May 15.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence DeWine released 4,300 inmates on May 15. A spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections said the post “is not accurate.” Fact Check:  Several states have released inmates in an effort to contain the spread of the new coronavirus behind bars, according to The New York Times. This particular post claims DeWine freed 4,300 inmates on May 15.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Ohio governor released 4,300 prisoners today!” the viral post reads. “Now he is warning residents of possible crime wave! Seriously you can’t fix stupid!!” The Daily Caller didn’t find any evidence that DeWine released 4,300 inmates on that date. Had he done so, media outlets would have reported it, as some did when DeWine authorized the release of 105 inmates on April 15, yet no news coverage could be found. DeWine also sent out a tweet when he authorized the release of 105 inmates.  Earlier today, I approved the early release of 105 inmates in Ohio. Each inmate will be tested to determine if they have #COVID19 before release. — Governor Mike DeWine (@GovMikeDeWine) April 15, 2020   “Earlier today, I approved the early release of 105 inmates in Ohio,” he tweeted. “Each inmate will be tested to determine if they have #COVID19 before release.” But a search of DeWine’s verified social media accounts turned up no announcement about such a release of over 4,000 inmates on May 15. (RELATED: Was Joe Exotic Transferred To The Cass County Jail In Texas?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Dan Tierney, DeWine’s press secretary, told the Caller that “Ohio has released 129 inmates early due to COVID-19.” That figure does not include inmates whose sentences concluded or those who were released due to a judicial order, according to Tierney. JoEllen Smith, a spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections confirmed to the Caller that the post “is not accurate,” noting that Ohio’s prison population has decreased by 2,360 since March 24. Over 4,700 Ohio inmates have tested positive for the coronavirus and just over 70 confirmed others have died as of May 28, according to data from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections. Earlier this month, a group of inmates filed a class-action lawsuit against DeWine and the state’s prison director, asking the judge to free thousands of inmates who are older or have medical conditions that put them at serious health risk if they contract the coronavirus, Cleveland Plain Dealer reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The photo, taken in 2009, predates the start of President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign. Fact Check: Featured in the image are people dressed in KKK regalia holding a banner that reads, “Trump Pence Make America Great Again.” The caption reads, “America, I believe this is all you need to know about why you should vote Blue in 2020.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show The KKK Marching At The 1924 Democratic National Convention)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the photo has been digitally manipulated. In the edited picture, the Trump-Pence campaign slogan has been superimposed over the words “Fraternal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan” on the banner. The original photo, found on Getty Images, shows members of the Fraternal White Knights of the KKK participating in a march recognizing the birthday of Nathan Bedford Forrest, the first grand wizard of the KKK, in Pulaski Tennessee, according to its caption. It was taken in July 2009, almost five years before Trump announced his presidential campaign in 2015. During the 2016 presidential election cycle, former KKK leader David Duke and KKK publication The Crusader expressed support for Trump. The then-candidate disavowed both endorsements.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Mayweather boxed professionally from roughly 1996 to 2015, winning world championship titles in several weight classes, according to Sports Illustrated. In December 2019, Forbes named him the highest paid athlete of the decade, with an estimated $915 million in earnings.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 1,100 times, masquerades as a giveaway from Mayweather. It features a short video of the former boxer holding stacks of $100 bills as he talks about counting the money. (He does not mention giveaways at any point in the video.) “Hello Every Body, I will randomly select people on Facebook, everyone who shares will receive a gift card, cash, and a big winner can win a car,” the Facebook post’s caption states. “I will choose 500 lucky people.” A closer inspection of the account reveals it is not affiliated with Mayweather. It has the wrong name – Floyd Mayweather Jr TMT rather than Floyd Mayweather – and lacks a blue verification check mark. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Ellen DeGeneres Is Giving Away $5,000 To 100 People Who Like And Comment On It) Searching Mayweather’s verified social media pages and websites turned up no similar contests. Nor have media outlets reported on Mayweather holding such a giveaway. The post appears to be a scam.  This isn’t the first time the former professional boxer has been the target of a social media scam. In 2015, the fact-checking website Snopes debunked a Facebook post claiming Mayweather would give away $2.6 million to a fan.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/106597274169383/videos/253467822565703/,https://www.si.com/boxing/2017/08/25/floyd-mayweather-boxing-record-stats,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2019/12/23/the-highest-paid-athletes-of-the-decade-mayweatherronaldo-lebron-score/#79c3ffb172d9,https://www.facebook.com/106597274169383/videos/253467822565703/,https://www.facebook.com/106597274169383/videos/253467822565703/,https://www.facebook.com/Floyd-Mayweatherr-Jr-TMT-106597274169383/,https://www.facebook.com/floydmayweather/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/26/fact-check-ellen-degeneres-giving-away-5000-like-comment-scam/,https://www.google.com/search?q=%22big+winner%22+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffloydmayweather%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FFloydMayweather%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Ffloydmayweather%2F%5D&oq=%22big+winner%22+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Ffloydmayweather%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FFloydMayweather%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Ffloydmayweather%2F%5D&aqs=chrome..69i57.1234j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.google.com/search?q=big+winner+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fmayweatherpromotions.com%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fthemoneyteam.com%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttp%3A%2F%2Ftfmjf.org%2F%5D&oq=big+winner+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fmayweatherpromotions.com%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fthemoneyteam.com%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttp%3A%2F%2Ftfmjf.org%2F%5D&aqs=chrome..69i57.5641j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://news.google.com/search?q=%22floyd%20mayweather%20jr%22%20AND%20%22giveaway%22%20AND%20%22prize%22&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-money-team/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1f6b6d7a69706d5f7b7e7673667c7e73737a6d317c7072",Is Floyd Mayweather Jr Giving Money To People Who Share This Video?,,,,,

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) refuted the claim. Fact Check: Fauci, the director of the NIAID, has become a popular target for misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case, social media users claim Fauci has said every American should be microchipped.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Dr. Fauci says every American should be microchipped,” one viral post states. “The only chip going in my body will have Salsa on it.” (RELATED: Has Anthony Fauci Ever Sat On Microsoft’s Board?) The Daily Caller found no credible report of Fauci discussing the idea of microchipping Americans online. Neither the NIAID nor the National Institutes of Health mention such a potential policy on their respective websites. Fauci saying a comment to that effect would be picked up by media outlets, yet none have, except to debunk it. In an email to the Caller, the NIAID confirmed that Fauci has “never said any such thing.” (RELATED: Has Anthony Fauci Ever Sat On Microsoft’s Board?) While there is no record of Fauci advocating for microchipping, he has publicly talked about the possibility of Americans carrying certificates of COVID-19 immunity.  “You know, that’s possible. It’s one of those things that we talk about when we want to make sure that we know who the vulnerable people are and not,” Fauci said in an interview with CNN. “This is something that’s being discussed. I think it might actually have some merit under certain circumstances.” Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has also been the subject of similar claims on Facebook, but those have also been debunked.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/worrall/posts/3519234671426561,https://www.facebook.com/worrall/posts/3519234671426561,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/14/fact-check-anthony-fauci-microsoft-board-directors-bill-gates/,https://www.google.com/search?q=Fauci+microchips&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS890US890&oq=Fauci+microchips&aqs=chrome..69i57.7551j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.niaid.nih.gov/search/niaidsite?search=microchip,https://search.nih.gov/search?affiliate=nih&commit=Search&page=1&query=microchip&utf8=%E2%9C%93,https://www.google.com/search?q=Fauci+Microchips+news&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS890US890&oq=Fauci+Microchips+news&aqs=chrome..69i57j33.8678j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/may/19/facebook-posts/dr-fauci-didnt-say-americans-should-be-microchippe/?fbclid=IwAR09uG8nrpgC7XzboH8KvJ4cxSuSkrtQfKWV-uAr0Jl9QzjNF-jCexrP_K4,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-fauci-microchip/false-claim-fauci-says-every-american-should-be-microchipped-idUSKBN22Y27E,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/14/fact-check-anthony-fauci-microsoft-board-directors-bill-gates/,https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/04/10/dr-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-full-interview-newday-vpx.cnn,https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/04/10/dr-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-full-interview-newday-vpx.cnn,https://www.facebook.com/cherie.waluk/posts/10221824161703475,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-gates-fauci-idUSKBN22H2JD?fbclid=IwAR2pCwFeCr4jZr87_XOwbxixM2i2AcEJEqeoPG_W5WYpS5tSS5rIqjcBUD8,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#45313720332a370521242c293c2624292920376b262a28",Did Dr Anthony Fauci Say All Americans Should Be Microchipped?,,,,,

Fact Check: The House passed on May 15 the HEROES Act, which provides assistance to state and local governments and bolsters Medicaid and Medicare, among other things, according to CBS News.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Multiple Facebook users have claimed House Democrats “snuck” in a provision that keeps the House in recess until July 21, with one such post saying, “The House Democrats snuck a provision in their $3 trillion bailout bill today that would keep the House in recess until July 21. Remind me again why we have to pay their $174,000+ salaries if they’re refusing to go to work?” In a search of the HEROES Act, also known as H.R. 6800, no such language about an extended recess could be found. A Democratic House leadership aide confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that there is no provision related to congressional recess in the HEROES Act. Earlier on May 15, the House approved H.R. 967, a resolution that set forth the rules for debate on both the HEROES Act and H.R. 965, which allows for proxy voting. The resolution did not contain any language outlining an extended recess but did state the House could adjourn “on any legislative day during the period from May 19, 2020, through July 21, 2020.” That sort of language is standard practice in House rules, according to USA Today. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Hide $25 Million For Congressional Pay Raises In The House Coronavirus Stimulus Bill?)

Fox News has not reported that Trump tested positive for COVID-19. Fact Check: The video, posted on May 18, shows footage of the White House, along with a chyron that reads, “Trump tests positive for COVID-19.” (RELATED: Did An MSNBC Reported Say, ‘I Hope Enough People Die From Coronavirus That It Harms Trump’s Re-Election’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Brought to you just a moment ago, Fox News alert: the White House medical team confirming President Donald Trump has confirmed positive for the coronavirus,” a news anchor can be heard saying. “The White House just put out a statement.” Through a keyword search, the Daily Caller found the original clip published on Fox News’ official YouTube channel on May 7. A comparison of the two videos revealed that the Facebook clip has been deceptively edited.The original segment, which features anchor Sandra Smith, discusses how one of Trump’s personal valets tested positive for COVID-19. In the Facebook video, the words “a valet to” have been cut out of Smith’s delivery to make it seem like the president, rather than the valet, tested positive. The word “valet” has also been digitally removed from the Fox News chyron, which actually read, “Trump valet tests positive for COVID-19.” Shortly after the valet tested positive, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for the coronavirus, The Associated Press reported May 7. Trump more recently told reporters on May 21 that he had tested “positively toward negative” in his daily coronavirus test that morning, according to The Hill.  There is no record of Fox News reporting that the president had tested positive for COVID-19.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/100010708655466/videos/1151687311864880/,https://www.facebook.com/100010708655466/videos/1151687311864880/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/17/fact-check-msnbc-hope-enough-people-die-coronavirus-harms-trump-reelection/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmqLB5pDj3Y&app=desktop,https://www.facebook.com/100010708655466/videos/1151687311864880/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmqLB5pDj3Y&app=desktop,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/07/politics/trump-valet-tests-positive-covid-19/index.html,https://www.facebook.com/100010708655466/videos/1151687311864880/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmqLB5pDj3Y&app=desktop,https://apnews.com/f21c076d1b0c6fe2af29d9550e54f10d,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/498990-trump-on-his-latest-coronavirus-test-i-tested-positively-toward,https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/search?q=%22donald%20trump%22%20AND%20%22positive%22%20AND%20%22coronavirus%22%20AND%20%22covid-19%22https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/search?q=%22donald%20trump%22%20AND%20%22positive%22%20AND%20%22coronavirus%22%20AND%20%22covid-19%22,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#13676176657c615377727a7f6a70727f7f76613d707c7e",Does This Video Show A Fox News Segment Saying Trump Tested Positive For COVID-19?,,,,,

Contact tracing is the process of public health officials making contact with infected individuals, identifying other people who have been exposed and making contact with those individuals to curb the spread of an infectious disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Amy Reynolds, communications director for the Washington State Department of Health, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that “participation in contact tracing is voluntary.” The Washington State Department of Health website also notes that the program is voluntary and that “there is no penalty for declining an interview” with contact tracers. The Lynnwood Times updated its article May 20 to clarify that “individuals that refuse testing” may be subject to such restriction, but that claim doesn’t hold up either. Reynolds confirmed to the DCNF that there is no penalty for refusing COVID-19 testing and that the state “is not aware of any authority that would require someone to be tested for COVID-19.” “People who test positive for COVID-19 are allowed to leave their homes, as are people who refuse a test after they’ve been exposed. People who have COVID symptoms are also allowed to leave their homes,” Reynolds said in an email. “Obviously, that’s not what we want them to do. We urge people to stay home and away from others in these instances, because it’s the best way to prevent the spread of disease.”  The confusion appears to stem from the controversy surrounding what happens when an infected or exposed individual refuses to self-isolate. (RELATED: Does The Australian Government’s COVIDSafe App Track Users’ Locations?) “The authority to involuntary isolate or quarantine an individual rests with local health officers,” reads a Washington State Department of Health statement. “Each local health jurisdiction in Washington has plans and processes in place should involuntary isolation or quarantine be needed. This authority is rarely used as a last resort when someone is intentionally putting others at risk.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Reynolds noted that a “vast majority of people” are willing to stay home voluntarily when asked “because they care about the wellbeing of others in their communities.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Riches confirmed that he is the man in the photo but claims the hat and hand have been superimposed into it. Fact Check: Chauvin and three other Minneapolis police officers were fired after a video surfaced of Chauvin kneeling on the neck of a black man, even after the man, Floyd, repeatedly said he could not breathe. Floyd later died at a hospital.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Amid the national outcry over Floyd’s death, social media users started sharing on May 27 a real photo of Chauvin juxtaposed with another picture of a man wearing a “Make Whites Great Again” hat. They claim the picture on the right also shows the former Minneapolis police officer. “This is the Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin that killed #GeorgeFloyd wearing a custom made hat that says, ‘Make Whites Great Again,'” reads one Facebook post that has since been deleted. The picture also has circulated widely on Twitter, where it has been labeled “manipulated media.”  A wolf in wolves clothing. The demons are among us. #Fightthecowards pic.twitter.com/UYw7zXNabQ — Ice Cube (@icecube) May 27, 2020    The man pictured on the right is not Chauvin, but rather Riches, an internet troll and former federal inmate known for posting misleading photos online and filing thousands of lawsuits, per the Washington Post. Riches confirmed in a Facebook message to the Daily Caller News Foundation that it is him in the photo, but claimed that the hat and the hand, which appears to be forming the OK sign that has been used by white supremacists, have been digitally inserted into the image.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “That is a photoshopped hat that I have no idea who did,” Riches told the DCNF. “I think the Hand is photoshopped too.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Gov Kemp Posing With Gregory McMichael?) Riches was unable to provide the original picture. It was first posted to Riches’ wall by a Facebook user who claims to be one of Riches’ relatives, and other Facebook users have shared screen grabs of it, according to Snopes. The background and style of the photo being shared online appear to match others found on Riches’ Facebook page.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    People have widely shared the poem “Let’s All Drink to Lockdown” on social media with attribution to Ayres in recent weeks. The poem compares an elderly woman’s experiences during the coronavirus pandemic to those during previous points in her life, such as the “sex and drugs and rock ‘n roll” of the 1960s. Ayres, known for works such as “With These Hands” and “Up In The Attic,” did not write the poem, however.

Three days after posting it, the poem had been shared more than 1,400 times and garnered more than 500 comments, according to Ryman Healthcare, the firm that operates the retirement village where Beaumont lives in New Zealand. “It took me all of 20 minutes,” Beaumont is quoted as saying on Ryman Healthcare’s website. “It was just something to pass the time really and to give my friends a giggle and now it’s gone to the UK, Canada, South Africa, America, Australia… and that’s just on my page!”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Beaumont addressed the misattribution in a comment on her Facebook page.

The use of cloth or surgical masks does not pose a carbon dioxide risk to people. Fact Check: The Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance in April that recommended Americans wear face coverings in public to curb the transmission of the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post claims Adams advised healthy people against wearing masks because breathing exhaled carbon dioxide can make them sick, saying, “US Surgeon General says if you are healthy and wearing a mask, you are actually making yourself sick by prolonged breathing of co2.” There is, however, no record of Adams making such a statement online. A search of his social media accounts didn’t turn up any similar remarks either. Had he said something to that effect, it likely would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it. “Surgeon General Adams has never issued such a warning,” a spokesperson for the surgeon general confirmed to the Daily Caller in an email. “We encourage anyone who has questions about cloth face coverings and how to wear them to consult the official CDC guidance.” The Daily Caller didn’t find any evidence that the Surgeon General’s office said it either. (RELATED: Viral Image Gives Inaccurate Instructions For Wearing Surgical Masks)  Other fact-checkers have debunked the claim that the prolonged use of cloth or surgical masks by the general public poses a risk of hypercapnia, the condition that occurs when there is too much carbon dioxide in the blood. N95 masks can increase carbon dioxide levels in the blood among individuals with certain health issues, but those masks aren’t recommended for the general public, according to PolitiFact. “The CO2 will slowly build up in the mask over time. However, the level of CO2 likely to build up in the mask is mostly tolerable to people exposed to it,” a representative from the CDC told Reuters. “You might get a headache but you most likely [would] not suffer the symptoms observed at much higher levels of CO2. The mask can become uncomfortable for a variety of reasons including a sensitivity to CO2 and the person will be motivated to remove the mask. It is unlikely that wearing a mask will cause hypercapnia.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Rajoelina accused the World Health Organisation of a plot to have its COVID-19 Organics, the local African ‘cure’ for the virus poisoned. According to his claims, WHO offered a $20 million bribe to poisoned their medicine, Tanzania Perspective reported on the front-page of its 14th May edition. #covid #scamdemic #who #arrestbillgates #plandemic #flattenthecurve #stayhome #trump #inthistogether #savelives A post shared by  RethinkVaccines (@rethinkvaccines) on May 18, 2020 at 3:38am PDT   Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  There is no record of Rajoelina making such an allegation.

Rajoelina launched in April an herbal drink, Covid Organics, that he has claimed can prevent and cure COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.

Fahari Yetu, a Tanzania newspaper, claimed the Madagascan president made the allegation during a recent interview with the French media outlet France 24. Rajoelina did have an interview with France 24 earlier in May. The Daily Caller News Foundation reviewed the entirety of the roughly 17-minute exclusive interview, which was translated into English and posted on France 24’s official YouTube Channel, and found no mention of a bribe. BBC News, which wrote about the interview, did not mention the Madagascan president saying the WHO had offered him a bribe in its reporting. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Madagascar Found A ‘Coronavirus Medicine’ That Can ‘Wipe Out The Virus’ In 6 Days) The DCNF found no record of Rajoelina saying the WHO attempted to bribe him to poison Covid Organics elsewhere. Lova Ranoramoro, director of the presidential office, told AFP Fact Check, “The Madagascan presidency absolutely denies all these allegations.”  The Tanzania Perspective has previously published inaccurate claims, according to Africa Check and AFP Fact Check.

Author Lori Gallagher Witt wrote it in January 2018. Fact Check: The viral Facebook post lists 16 beliefs allegedly held by the “majority of liberals” that Howard knows on political issues such as immigration, health care, taxation and social programs. It also includes an accompanying photo of Howard.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “I’m a liberal, but that doesn’t mean what a lot of you apparently think it does,” reads the introduction of the essay. “Let’s break it down, shall we? Because quite frankly, I’m getting a little tired of being told what I believe and what I stand for.” (RELATED: Did Charlie Daniels Say, ‘Voting For Trump Is Like Playing Country Music Backwards’?) But Howard did not author the open letter. A search of the filmmaker’s verified social media accounts did not yield any results for the essay. Nor did an internet search turn up any credible sources attributing the essay to him. The open letter, debunked by several fact-checking websites, was actually written by Witt. Her Facebook post, which only contained 15 beliefs, has been shared over 25,000 times since she posted it on Jan. 7, 2018. It includes a copyright notice and the words “Feel free to share, but please give me credit, and if you add or change anything, please note accordingly.” Witt told Reuters that the misattribution to Howard started in January 2020, after a man with the same name as the filmmaker posted her words without properly citing her. People posted it “as originating from THE Ron Howard, and it went wild from there,” Witt said, according to Reuters.  While Howard did not write the open letter, he has spoken publicly about his political beliefs in the past. In 2016, he tweeted that he has voted for both parties but planned to vote for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Mitt Romney endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for president.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Romney endorsing Biden. The claim comes from a satirical news website. Fact Check: The claim that Romney endorsed Biden for president is accompanied by a quote attributed to the Utah senator.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “I cannot, in good faith, and with hands raised to Heavenly Father, throw any manner of assistance towards the President and risk having four more years of his ineptitude and sheer criminality screwing over our country,” Romney is quoted as saying. “Joe Biden is at least sane, capable, and not Representative of Nazis and racists. I intend to contribute my, and my State’s efforts to the rising Joementum movement in order to save America from a severely mentally handicapped evil gorilla and his pea-brained followers. Amen.” Both the quote and the claim come from Daily World Update, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” The article, which puts up the headline “Romney Endorses Joe Biden,” was posted under the “Deep State fan Fiction for the Derp State” category. The Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports about Romney endorsing Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Biden’s campaign also has not mentioned anything to that effect in a press release, nor has Romney’s office. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims The Constitution Allows The President To Seek Extra Terms If Impeached But Not Removed) “I’m not planning on endorsing in the presidential race,” Romney told CNN in September 2019. “At this stage, I’m not planning on endorsing in the primary or in the general.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A Black Rifle Coffee Company spokesperson confirmed it is not affiliated with Black Rifle Company. Fact Check: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on May 1 an immediate ban on the sale and use of over 1,500 models and variants of assault-style firearms, The Associated Press reported. The ban came roughly two weeks after a gunman killed 22 people in Nova Scotia.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Black Rifle Coffee Company tweeted on May 6 a screen grab of part of the list of banned firearms, saying, “Say it ain’t so @JustinTrudeau did you really ban our Fresh Roasted Freedom in Canada eh?” The phrase “Black Rifle Company BRC15B” is outlined in red in the screen grab tweeted by Black Rifle Coffee Company. The tweet prompted reactions from social media users: one Twitter user said, “Oh. My. God. Canada banned coffee in its idiotic new gun ban,” while a Facebook user screen grabbed the exchange and commented, “Lay off the crack Canada.” Despite having similar names, Black Rifle Coffee Company is not the same as the Black Rifle Company that manufactures the firearm outlined in red. Black Rifle Coffee Company is a veteran-run American coffee company, whereas Black Rifle Company is a rifle manufacturer. The new law makes no mention of coffee or the Black Rifle Coffee Company. (RELATED: Is Texas The Only State That Can Fly Its Flag At The Same Height As The American Flag?)  “Black Rifle Coffee Co. does not have any affiliation with Black Rifle Company,” Farahn Morgan, a spokesperson for Black Rifle Coffee Company, told the Daily Caller in an email. “Black Rifle Coffee Company is still serving its fresh, freedom-fueled coffee to our neighbors to the North.” Black Rifle Coffee Company appears to have tweeted the comment as a joke, but many took it as genuine, according to the fact-checking website Lead Stories.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The post masquerades as an official giveaway from DeGeneres, saying, “I will selectively choose people on Facebook, ‘Everyone I comment on’ WIN ‘will receive a gift card, cash and the BIG WINNER can get a car and money’ SHARE NOW, don’t miss it! We are watching !!! I will choose 100 lucky people $5,000 each by following the instructions.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, a closer inspection of the account reveals that it is not affiliated in any way with DeGeneres. It has the wrong name – The Ellens Fund rather than Ellen DeGeneres – and lacks the blue check mark, which notes that the account has been verified by Facebook. The alleged giveaway doesn’t hold up under scrutiny either. No such giveaway appears on any of the talk show host’s social media pages, nor on the official website of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” where official giveaways are posted. It appears to be a scam. Similar scams about DeGeneres giving away various monetary amounts for likes, shares and comments have circulated on Facebook over the years, according to Snopes.

Fact Check: The Facebook post makes the claim while questioning why some small businesses and meatpacking plants have been shut down or prevented from reopening.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “All of these companies have not had any reported cases in the news,” reads the post. “Yet, every employee in these companies encounters thousands of people a day. None of these companies have closed stores. However all of a sudden all the meat packing plants are closing and small businesses are still not allowed to open. None of this makes any sense at all.” In reality, the five companies mentioned in the post have had employees test positive for coronavirus, and media outlets have reported on it. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Defective Medical Gowns Made In China?) Local media outlets have widely reported on COVID-19 infections among Walmart employees in recent weeks. For instance, CBS affiliate WRGB reported that two Walmart employees had tested positive for coronavirus. A Walmart store in Massachusetts closed in April after 23 employees tested positive, according to local affiliate NBC10. Reuters reported in late March that 19 Amazon warehouses across the U.S. had positive cases of COVID-19. Other media outlets have also documented cases among Amazon employees at company facilities in New York, Connecticut, Delaware and Florida.  13 employees at 10 different Kroger stores in the Louisville, Kentucky, division tested positive for COVID-19, according to local ABC affiliate WHAS. There have been cases among Target employees in states such as North Dakota, Texas and Virginia, per media reports. Target employees in Georgia, North Carolina and California have also tested positive.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  In late March, BuzzFeed News reported that Costco employees said managers in at least eight locations informed staff that a coworker had tested positive. (RELATED: Did Walmart Introduce A Staggered Shopping Schedule By Age Amid The Coronavirus Pandemic?) The post’s claim that “none of these companies have closed stores” doesn’t hold up either. Amazon closed a warehouse indefinitely in Kentucky after three workers testing positive in March, according to Business Insider. A Walmart in Colorado was also closed by local authorities in late April after eight employees tested positive for COVID-19, Bloomberg reported. Essential small businesses, like local grocery stores and pet stores, have been permitted to stay open under stay-at-home orders. As some states have started lifting restrictions aimed to curb the spread of coronavirus, nonessential small businesses such as gyms, nail salons and tattoo parlors have been able to reopen, according to CNBC. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in late April meant to reopen or keep meatpacking facilities open by designating them “critical infrastructure.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10222185563685135&set=a.1828997401773&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10222185563685135&set=a.1828997401773&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10222185563685135&set=a.1828997401773&type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/29/fact-check-video-defective-medical-gowns-made-china/,https://cbs6albany.com/news/coronavirus/employee-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-at-east-greenbush-walmart,https://www.nbcboston.com/news/coronavirus/mass-walmart-closed-for-cleaning-after-23-employees-test-positive-for-coronavirus/2116250/,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-amazon-com-warehou/factbox-coronavirus-cases-reported-at-19-of-amazons-us-warehouses-idUSKBN21I0FA,https://nypost.com/2020/04/06/amazon-faces-another-staten-island-warehouse-strike/,https://patch.com/connecticut/northhaven/north-haven-coronavirus-update-4-amazon-workers-test-positive,https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-confirms-more-cases-of-coronavirus-in-delaware-2020-4?r=MX&IR=T,https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/second-covid-19-case-diagnosed-at-jacksonville-amazon-facility/77-fc745559-337c-46c1-9a77-f7ea02f33505,https://www.whas11.com/article/news/investigations/focus/three-lou-area-krogers-deep-cleaned-after-employees-test-positive-for-covid-19/417-41c10bf3-e22a-4150-a868-33542add1e60,https://www.kvrr.com/2020/04/27/target-confirms-employee-at-fargo-store-has-covid-19/,https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/second-employee-at-west-el-paso-target-tests-positive-for-covid-19,https://www.richmond.com/business/target-employee-in-short-pump-tests-positive-for-the-coronavirus/article_06497611-e69c-5c82-b4b3-95839f82c2d5.html,https://www.wrdw.com/content/news/Target-confirms-infection--of-employee-at-store-in-Evans-569919051.html,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/coronavirus/article241870676.html,https://patch.com/california/livermore/livermore-target-employee-tests-positive-coronavirus,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/costco-employees-testing-positive-covid-19,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/14/fact-check-walmart-introduce-staggered-shopping-schedule-age-coronavirus/,https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-indefinitely-closes-us-warehouse-covid-19-2020-3,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/walmart-store-shut-by-colorado-after-three-coronavirus-deaths,https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-nonessential-business-essential-business-coronavirus-2020-3,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-24/walmart-store-shut-by-colorado-after-three-coronavirus-deaths,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/economy/coronavirus-trump-meat-food-supply.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#275355425148556743464e4b5e44464b4b42550944484a","Have Walmart, Amazon, Kroger, Target And Costco Had No Reported COVID-19 Cases?",,,,,

The artist that painted the portrait being shared has confirmed it is not an official portrait. Fact Check: The unveiling of Obama’s official portrait in a ceremony hosted by President Donald Trump at the White House will reportedly not take place, sources familiar with the matter told NBC News earlier this month. Katie Hill, a spokesperson for Obama, declined to comment to NBC News at the time, and so did the White House.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The tradition of sitting presidents inviting their immediate predecessor to the White House to unveil their official portrait has been maintained for decades, according to CNN. (Did Obama Award The Presidential Medal Of Freedom To Clinton, Cosby, Weiner And Weinstein?) The Facebook post, which features a painting of Obama posing in a tan suit, claims that it is the former president’s official White House portrait, saying, “Here is the painting traditionally hung in the White House with a (sic) unveiling ceremony. It will not happen By mutual agreement as Trump with (sic) not hang it up…while he occupies.” But the painting displayed in the Facebook post was created by Dutch artist Edwin van den Dikkenberg, who has confirmed that it was not an official presidential portrait. A similar claim about his painting previously circulated on Twitter in 2017, BuzzFeed News reported. “I’m very pleased to hear that my portrait of Barack Obama appeared on Twitter!” he told BuzzFeed News in 2017. “I wish I had the opportunity to paint the official portrait but that’s not the case.”  Recent Facebook posts making similar claims have also featured the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s official portrait of Obama. That painting, created by Kehinde Wiley, is an official portrait of the former president but differs from the official White House portrait, which is commissioned by the White House Historical Association, according to Snopes. The official White House portrait of Obama has not been released so far. The White House Historical Association’s online presidential portrait gallery currently shows a photo of Obama instead of a painting.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/marguerite.benoit.505/posts/272743650444968,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/white-house-portrait-ceremony-may-be-latest-casualty-political-divide-n1209676,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/white-house-portrait-ceremony-may-be-latest-casualty-political-divide-n1209676,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/20/politics/white-house-portrait-unveilings/index.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/07/18/fact-check-obama-presidential-medal-freedom-clinton-cosby-weiner-weinstein/,https://www.facebook.com/marguerite.benoit.505/posts/272743650444968,https://edwinvandendikkenberg.nl/in-de-media/,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/remysmidt/the-audicity-of-nope-taupe,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/remysmidt/the-audicity-of-nope-taupe,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/remysmidt/the-audicity-of-nope-taupe,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=123025802733535&set=gm.1353612751694893&type=3&theater,https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2018.16,https://npg.si.edu/object/npg_NPG.2018.16,https://www.whitehousehistory.org/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-white-house-portrait/,https://www.whitehousehistory.org/galleries/presidential-portraits,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3878196859c81b397929a9f8a90929f9f9681dd909c9e",Does This Image Show Barack Obama’s Official White House Portrait?,,,,,

The field hospital only helped treat New York City coronavirus patients. Fact Check: The long text post credits President Donald Trump with the alleged rescue of the abused children from underground captivity, where they had purportedly been “kept as sex slaves” since birth.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “These precious children have been kept there as sex slaves from birth. For sexual satanic abuse rituals and for human doping to use their blood for drinking in satanic rituals for the very elite,” reads the post, in all capital letters. “The pedophile rings are being brought down across America now as we speak, where hundreds of these underground tunnels have been found and blown up after all the children have been taken out.” It further claims the Central Park tent hospital run by nonprofit Samaritan’s Purse housed the rescued children. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Military Vehicles Arriving In New York City During The Coronavirus Pandemic?) But the claims are baseless. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting to corroborate any of the claims made in the post. Kaitlyn Lahm, a Samaritan’s Purse spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that “these are totally false rumors.” The Central Park field hospital received extensive media coverage during its roughly one month of operation. The facility treated nearly 200 coronavirus patients, who have all since been discharged, in partnership with the Mount Sinai Health System, according to the Samaritan’s Purse website.  “We worked hand-in-hand with Mount Sinai Hospital to bring desperately needed surge capacity,” Lahm told PolitiFact. “All patients treated at the Emergency Field Hospital were transferred from Mount Sinai to Samaritan’s Purse.” The field hospital would have been logistically incapable of housing “thousands of babies and children,” as it was a “14-tent, 68-bed respiratory care unit,” per the Samaritan’s Purse website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The claims made in the Facebook post appear to reference a QAnon conspiracy theory, which “centers on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the ‘deep state’ and a child sex trafficking ring run by satanic pedophiles and cannibals,” according to The Associated Press.

It predates the first coronavirus cases in Zimbabwe by several months. Fact Check: Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced on May 16 that the nationwide lockdown would be extended “for an indefinite period,” Al Jazeera reported. The measure, meant to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, includes a ban on public gatherings of more than 50 people, including worship services.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral Facebook post claims to show footage of Zimbabwean police beating churchgoers who “refused to obey the law and went to church.” In the video, police officers can be seen chasing people and hitting them with batons. Through a reverse image search of key frames, the Daily Caller found two clips of the video posted on YouTube in November 2019, months before Zimbabwe confirmed its first COVID-19 cases. Journalist Samira Sawlani also shared a similar video on Twitter in November of last year.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  A single member of parliament appeared to suggest Gates should be arrested. There is no evidence that the entire Italian Parliament supports such a move. Fact Check: The website Live 24 published the article with the headline “Italian Parliament Calls For The Arrest Of Bill Gates” on May 15. Yet, while the headline suggested the entire Italian legislative branch called for his arrest, the actual article only mentions one member of parliament suggesting such a move. “Sara Cunial who is a member of the Italian Parliament has delivered a controversial speed (sic) where she is calling for the arrest of Bill Gates,” reads the opening line. (RELATED: ‘Our Only Hope Remains Up In The Sky’ – Did Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Say This Quote About Coronavirus?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Italian politician Sara Cunial did suggest Gates should face charges for alleged “crimes against humanity” during a conspiracy theory-filled speech at Parliament in early May, according to multiple media reports. In closing, she said, “Dear President Conte, next time you receive a phone call from the ‘philanthropist’ Bill Gates, forward it directly to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity,” according to a translation. But there is no evidence that her position was endorsed by the rest of the Italian Parliament, as suggested by the headline. In the video of Cunial’s speech, other members of parliament can be heard interrupting with what seem to be verbal objections. Cunial belongs to Italy’s Five Star Movement, a political party that, per The New York Times, has opposed vaccines. In 2018, she was briefly suspended from the party after likening vaccines to “free genocide” in a Facebook post, according to the International Business Times. In recent months, Gates has become the subject of multiple conspiracy theories, including debunked claims about him “creating COVID-19 in order to profit from a vaccine, or of Gates being a member of a plot to cull humanity and/or implement a global surveillance system,” The Verge reported.

Part of the post comes from a 2007 satirical column. Fact Check: The viral post claims Obama made negative comments about the national anthem during a “Meet the Press” interview on Sept. 7, 2008. (RELATED: Did Michelle Obama Call Trump The ‘Dumbest President In US History’ In An Interview With Oprah Winfrey?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “As I’ve said about the flag pin, I don’t want to be perceived as taking sides. There are a lot of people in the world to whom the American flag is a symbol of oppression,” the then-senator is quoted as saying. “The anthem itself conveys a war-like message. You know, the bombs bursting in air and all that sort of thing.” The post further alleges that Obama suggested the national anthem be changed “for something less parochial and less bellicose” such as the song “I’d Like to Teach the World To Sing.” However, Obama never made any of the comments attributed to him in the Facebook post. They appear on neither his official websites nor his social media pages. The Daily Caller also didn’t find any media reports about him making such comments. Obama didn’t appear on the Sept. 7, 2008, episode of “Meet the Press,” further adding to the post’s dubiousness. Joe Biden, then a senator, and writer Thomas Friedman were the guests, according to the transcript.  Some of the post’s text appears to come from an October 2007 satire article by writer John Semmens. It was published as part of his series “Semi-News – A Satirical Look at Recent News” and clearly labeled as satire. The claim, debunked by Snopes in 2008, previously circulated as a chain email. Later versions of the text have also been falsely attributed to a fictional Washington Post reporter, according to Snopes.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/terry.johnston.716/posts/1962948347169471,https://www.facebook.com/terry.johnston.716/posts/1962948347169471,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/24/fact-check-michelle-obama-call-donald-trump-dumbest-president-history-oprah-winfrey-interview/,https://www.facebook.com/terry.johnston.716/posts/1962948347169471,https://www.facebook.com/terry.johnston.716/posts/1962948347169471,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eQhtAh-SJM,https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02RFuAIqi51VGKoGiUC3-8grDo-zA%3A1590155317686&ei=NdjHXsrIKd6fytMPvOaz0AQ&q=%22there+are+a+lot+of+people+in+the+world+to+whom+the+american+flag+is+a+symbol+of+oppression%22+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fbarackobama.com%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.obama.org%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fobamawhitehouse.archives.gov%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.obamalibrary.gov%2F%5D&oq=%22there+are+a+lot+of+people+in+the+world+to+whom+the+american+flag+is+a+symbol+of+oppression%22+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fbarackobama.com%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.obama.org%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fobamawhitehouse.archives.gov%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.obamalibrary.gov%2F%5D&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1DXBFjloAdg1rIHaARwAHgBgAHsA4gBqgmSAQc5LjEuNC0xmAEmoAEBoAECqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiKt-SWzsfpAhXej3IEHTzzDEoQ4dUDCAw&uact=5,https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03pqHi5LMNBfKKl72KOfQSfv-P0uQ%3A1590155479389&ei=19jHXverF4XD1QGmqbmoDw&q=%22there+are+a+lot+of+people+in+the+world+to+whom+the+american+flag+is+a+symbol+of+oppression%22+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FBarackObama%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbarackobama%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbarackobama%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fobamawhitehouse%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fobamafoundation%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fobamalibrary%2F%5D&oq=%22there+are+a+lot+of+people+in+the+world+to+whom+the+american+flag+is+a+symbol+of+oppression%22+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FBarackObama%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbarackobama%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fbarackobama%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fobamawhitehouse%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fobamafoundation%2F%5D+OR+site%3A%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fobamalibrary%2F%5D&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1DcwAFYkuwLYITyC2gAcAB4AIABT4gB4wOSAQE4mAE8oAEBoAECqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi38_HjzsfpAhWFYTUKHaZUDvUQ4dUDCAw&uact=5,https://www.nbcnews.com/id/26590488/ns/meet_the_press/t/meet-press-transcript-sept/#.XsfUZhNKjBI,https://www.nbcnews.com/id/26590488/ns/meet_the_press/t/meet-press-transcript-sept/#.XswUmhNKhBZ,https://web.archive.org/web/20080801043405/http://azconservative.org/Semmens118.htm,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/national-anthem-stance/,https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2008/wps-kornblut-gets-a-heads-up-on-the-e-mail-from-wper-dale-lindsborg/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/national-anthem-stance/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#11656374677e63517570787d6872707d7d74633f727e7c",Viral Post Claims Barack Obama Wanted To Change The National Anthem To ‘I’d Like To Teach The World To Sing’,,,,,

Fact Check: COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, primarily spreads through the respiratory drops expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral video shows a kitchen worker without a mask and only one glove blowing into small food wrappers to separate them. She then puts what appears to be muffins into the wrappers. Two other workers can be seen in the background also not wearing masks. “Check this out: Corona virus / droplets in full force,” reads the caption. “Let this go viral…. Wonder where this is?” (RELATED: Does This Video Show People Celebrating The End Of Saudi Arabia’s Coronavirus Lockdown?) The video, however, was not taken during the coronavirus pandemic. The Daily Caller found the video posted on the website Gfycat in March 2017 and on Russian websites that year around the same time. That means it predates the emergence of the new coronavirus in late 2019 by more than two years.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and experts say evidence indicates the coronavirus originated in animals and was not engineered in a lab. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The internet has become replete with misinformation related to the new coronavirus since it first emerged in China in late 2019. In this case, the Facebook post credits O’Reilly with writing an essay that claims the virus is a biological weapon created by the Chinese government. “Knowing they could not attack us openly they needed to be coy, like a deceptive fox,” O’Reilly allegedly wrote. “In my opinion, I believe the regime released a biological weapon upon the world that doesn’t kill everyone but kills ‘enough,’ especially the elderly and in-firmed.” There is, however, no evidence O’Reilly authored the essay. It appears nowhere on his website or his social media accounts. An internet search also turned up no credible sources attributing the essay to him. A spokesperson for O’Reilly’s website confirmed to Snopes that O’Reilly “did not write a single word of the essay in question,” adding that the political commentator “does not traffic in conspiracy theories.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show Blankets Infected With Coronavirus Being Shipped From China To Africa?)  The essay, debunked by Snopes in April, appears to have originated with Facebook user Tim Besmer, who posted it with a copyright notice and the words “Permission given for public sharing.” The fact-checking website Lead Stories rated his post false. The exact origin of the new coronavirus remains unknown, but experts believe it likely came from bats, CNN reported. Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told the Washington Post, “There’s absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The WHO has also said the available evidence indicates the coronavirus originated in animals and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory, according to USA Today.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  There is no record of Democrats introducing such a bill, and the senator quoted appears to be fictional. The claim stems from a satirical news website. Fact Check: The website BIZ News published the article, titled “Democrats Introduce Bill To ‘Euthanize Seniors’ To Save Social Security,” on May 10. It cites comments made by supposed Democratic Sen. Ginny Talia after a meeting of a Senate subcommittee. “Americans over 70 years old should just be euthanized,” it quotes the senator as saying. “That’s how to save social security.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But the claim that Democrats have introduced such a bill doesn’t hold up. A search of House and Senate legislation turned up no matching or similar bills. Media outlets have also not covered any bill to that effect. Nor is there any record of Talia serving in the Senate, according to GovTrack. She appears to be fictional. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say, ‘Social Security Recipients Are Just A Burden On Society’?)

The Daily Caller didn’t find any media outlets attributing the statement in the alleged tweet to him either. (RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A ‘Hoax’ At His South Carolina Rally?) Trump has criticized the Obama administration for leaving him an “empty” national stockpile. However, multiple fact-checkers have called the claim inaccurate, noting that while its stock of N95 masks was depleted, the national stockpile was not “empty.” Fact-checkers have also debunked the claim that the Obama administration didn’t leave behind a “pandemic playbook.” This isn’t the first time social media users have shared a fabricated Trump tweet during the coronavirus pandemic.

Fact Check: Featured in the photo is a crop circle shaped like the new coronavirus, which is named for the crown-like spikes on its surface. A version of the Microsoft Windows logo appears in the center of the outline of the virus. (RELATED: Does A Bill Gates-Funded Research Institute Own The Patent For Coronavirus?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral post uses the image to suggest a link between the new coronavirus and Gates, with the caption saying, “This crop circle appeared recently, featuring the Coronavirus image and the Microsoft logo. Hinting at a link between Bill Gates and the virus?” However, the image has been digitally altered. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found the unedited photo in the 2006 book “Crop Circles: Signs, Wonders and Mysteries.” The crop circle, purportedly created in Wiltshire, England, in 2004, actually shows a “stunning six-armed star,” according to the book. Other photos of the original crop circle appear on Temporary Temples, a website that documents crop circles through photography. The website’s Facebook page addressed the photoshopped image in an April 30 post.   “This image doing the rounds is Photoshopped taken from a full page photograph which was included in our book Signs Wonders and Mysteries,” the post reads. “It has been done by an individual who is well known for posting manipulated images, usually using my photographs.” This isn’t the first time social media users have attempted to link Gates to the new coronavirus, which first emerged in late 2019. In January, a viral Instagram post falsely claimed a “vaccine-production institute” funded by Gates owns the patent for the virus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: President Donald Trump signed into law on March 27 a $2.2 trillion stimulus package aimed at softening the economic blow of the coronavirus pandemic.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The bill included “economic impact payments” that amount to $1,200 payments for single adults that have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less and $2,400 payments for married couples that earn $150,000 or less, as well as $500 payments for qualifying dependents under the age of 17, according to The New York Times. Many Americans have already received their electronic coronavirus stimulus payments. A viral Facebook post falsely alleges in an image that Pelosi said, “If you accept a check from Trump, you might as well vote for him,” despite no record of her ever saying the statement. (RELATED: No, Coronavirus Stimulus Payments Are Not Tied To The 2020 Census) Searching Pelosi’s verified social media accounts and ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets turned up no matches. It also does not appear in any press releases put out by the House speaker’s office. In mid-April, Pelosi criticized Trump after media reports said the payments could be delayed to add his name to the checks, saying, “Delaying direct payments to vulnerable families just to print his name on the check is another shameful example of President Trump’s catastrophic failure to treat this crisis with the urgency it demands.”  The Treasury Department denied that printing Trump’s name was causing a delay, according to The Hill.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: In the photo, a large crowd gathers in what appears to be a large tent. The viral Facebook post alleges it shows Canadian Muslims in Calgary violating social distancing guidelines.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Check out the social distancing from Calgary Muslims during Ramadan,” reads the caption. “In Canada police have ticketed Canadians for walking their dog alone, playing private basketball with their children, but the Liberals’ chosen people remain like Trudeau, above the law.” The photo, found through a reverse image search, was taken months before the new coronavirus first emerged in China in late 2019. CBC reporter Dan McGarvey took the photo in August 2019 at the Akram Jomaa Islamic Center in Calgary. It shows members of Calgary’s Muslim community gathering to “mark the start of Eid al-Fitr,” per the caption. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, according to USA Today.

Adam Schiff will be charged with “presidential harassment.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence to corroborate the story. The claim originated on the satirical news website Bustatroll.org. Fact Check: Social media platforms are replete with misinformation about prominent politicians. In this case, the viral image, which appears to be a screen grab of an article, alleges that the House Intelligence Committee chairman is set to be charged with “presidential harassment.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    President Donald Trump has tweeted the phrase “presidential harassment” on numerous occasions. For instance, he tweeted the phrase on Sept. 24, 2019, the day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would initiate a formal impeachment inquiry against him. There is no news reporting to corroborate the alleged charge, however. The claim stems from an article on Bustatrolll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” Yet, while Bustatroll.org clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, the Facebook post fails to do so, portraying it as real.

Fact Check: False claims targeting Gates have circulated widely on social media amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, including one that claims the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation operates a “Center for Global Human Population Reduction.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post appears to reference such a conspiracy theory, while also linking the protests, purportedly in Germany, to the “deep state” and the “New World Order.” In the video, a massive crowd fills several streets, loudly protesting. (RELATED: Do Only Viruses Made In Laboratories Require Vaccines?) “#Germany erupts in massive protests against the #New_Corrupted_World_Order #Deepstate and the Nazi takeover of Eugenics World by the #BillGates sterilization and vaccine depopulation campaign, as they know this better than anyone with their history,” reads the video’s caption. Through a reverse image search of key frames, the Daily Caller found the video in a Daily Express article about a protest that occurred in Warsaw, Poland, in July 2017. Thousands rallied in Poland’s capital to protest against the ruling party’s move to take control of the judicial system, according to The Associated Press. A Google Maps street view of the Krakowskie Przedmieście promenade in Warsaw shows the same buildings as those in the video, confirming the location. Mass protests like the one pictured are not currently allowed in Germany, as the government announced in April that it would extend its ban on large gatherings until at least Aug. 31, Yahoo News reported.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/AstuciaDeLaRazon/videos/699647084124847/,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-05-16/coronacheck-number-16/12235726,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/04/fact-check-image-center-global-human-population-reduction-sign-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-headquarters/,https://www.facebook.com/AstuciaDeLaRazon/videos/699647084124847/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/15/fact-check-only-viruses-made-laboratories-require-vaccines/,https://www.facebook.com/AstuciaDeLaRazon/videos/699647084124847/,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/833598/poland-eu-latest-protests-warsaw-donald-tusk-european-union,https://apnews.com/f74dec88a839489e86848013b64c7717/Protests-across-Poland-over-law-to-control-judiciary,https://www.inyourpocket.com/warsaw/ul-krakowskie-przedmiescie_42007v,https://www.google.com.mx/maps/@52.2416458,21.0158194,3a,75y,132.43h,100.32t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sAF1QipPzfzpeGEASmwTHb_Kwzb8hqAkDKGCCpBE4mdW0!2e10!3e11!7i9104!8i4552,https://www.google.com.mx/maps/place/Karowa,+00-315+Warszawa,+Poland/@52.2418664,21.0143047,557m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x471ecc60b13dfc4d:0x9a394784527379da!8m2!3d52.2418664!4d21.0156155,https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-german-government-extends-ban-200801822.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afdbddcad9c0ddefcbcec6c3d6cccec3c3cadd81ccc0c2","Does This Video Show A Protest In Germany Against The ‘Deep State,’ Bill Gates?",,,,,

The organizations mentioned in the article have been linked to conspiracy theories in the past. Fact Check: The article, published by the website NBCM News, alleges that the queen and husband Prince Philip were found guilty in 2013 by “six judges of the International Common Law Court of Justice” in the Belgian capital of Brussels.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “After nearly a year of litigation, Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Phillip, were found guilty in the disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic-run Kamloops residential school in British Columbia,” the article alleged. “Grieving parents haven’t seen their children since they left for a picnic with the Royal couple on Oct. 10 1964.” But there is no truth to the article’s claim. The British royal family often makes headlines. If the queen had been found guilty of such a crime, it would have been picked up by major news outlets, yet none have reported on it, and Buckingham Palace has not issued a press release. Closer examination of the article reveals other red flags that add to its dubiousness. The two organizations, the “International Common Law Court of Justice” and the “International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State,” are not legally recognized governing bodies. Both are linked to the Canadian conspiracy theorist Kevin Annett, according to Snopes. This isn’t the first time the two organizations have appeared in conspiracy theories. (RELATED: Did Buckingham Palace Confirm Queen Elizabeth Tested Positive For Coronavirus?)  In 2015, Snopes debunked a claim that the “International Common Law Court of Justice” helped uncover the involvement of European royalty in “human hunting parties.” The other organization started a now-debunked 2013 rumor that Pope Benedict XVI resigned because of his “complicity in concealing child trafficking in his church and other crimes against humanity,” according to Snopes.

The tweet comes from a satirical blog. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post features a screen grab of a May 8 tweet, purportedly from Trump, that expresses support for the lifting of restrictions that many states have put in place to help curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “American shops want to open! Hair needs cutting. Demokraps don’t want to bite the bullet  but that’s the price we need to pay,” reads the tweet. “Some oldies will have to die. We’re in God’s hands, folks! Liberate America!” (RELATED: Did Trump Tweet He Won’t Send Coronavirus Stimulus Checks To People Who Tweet ‘#NOTMYPRESIDENT’?) There is, however, no record of Trump ever tweeting the comment. Searching the president’s Twitter accounts – @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS – and ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets turned up no matches. The Internet Archive also doesn’t show any such tweet in screen captures of his Twitter timeline that day. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the tweet stems from the “Laughing in Disbelief” blog on the website Patheos, which disclaims that “the story you were reading is satirical.” However, the Facebook post fails to issue a similar warning, portraying it as a real tweet.  In mid-April, Trump sent out a series of tweets calling to “liberate” states where people were protesting social distancing guidelines, USA Today reported. A number of states have started lifting some of their coronavirus restrictions, according to the Wall Street Journal.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

There is no evidence that Obama ever said or wrote the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. Fact Check: The conspiracy theory that Obama secretly practices Islam dates back over a decade and has been debunked numerous times. The viral image appears to play on that conspiracy theory, claiming Obama wrote on page 261 of his 2006 book “The Audacity of Hope” that “if the political winds should shift, I will side with the muslims.” But this is inaccurate. The quote does not appear on page 261 or any other page of the book. The Daily Caller News Foundation also found no evidence to suggest Obama ever said or wrote the statement elsewhere.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The purported quote, which has been circulating online for years, seems to be a misrepresentation of what Obama did say on page 261. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama Say He Is ‘Not Going To Allow White People To Kill Africans With Their Toxic Vaccines’?) On that page, Obama discusses what he learned from meeting with Arab and Pakistani Americans in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He notes that they told him about “detentions and FBI questioning and hard stares from neighbors that have shaken their sense of security and belonging.” They sought assurances “that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction,” according to Obama. The passage never mentions religion. A reference to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II makes it clear that Obama is talking about the two groups in the context of discrimination. “They have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly,” reads the passage. “They need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II.”  This is not the first time a fake quote attributed to the former president has circulated.

Thunberg’s team has confirmed she has never made such a statement. Fact Check: Thunberg, who addressed world leaders at a United Nations climate summit in New York City in 2019, first gained global attention for skipping school to protest against inaction on climate change outside the Swedish parliament. She took all of 2019 off from school to continue her campaign, including attending key climate conferences and joining student protests around the world, BBC News reported. The post alleges Thunberg asked the Chinese government to “stop using their traditional chopsticks” to save trees. It further claims that, in response, the Chinese government “advised Greta Thunberg to return to school, where she will learn that the sticks are made of bamboo, and that bamboo is a plant, not a tree.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence in an internet search that Thunberg ever called on the Chinese government to stop using chopsticks, only other fact-checkers debunking the claim. The DCNF also searched Thunberg’s verified Twitter account but did not find comments to this effect. Her team confirmed to Reuters that she made no such statement. It is unclear from where exactly the fake story originated, but Reuters traced an early iteration of the claim to a Jan. 14 tweet. (RELATED: Does This Picture Show Greta Thunberg With George Soros?)

Cuz it is a symbol of environmental destruction,” reads the tweet. “#GretaThunberg you acclaim panda to stop biting bamboo. I think you should shut up. Cuz you waste oxygen and made smelly CO2 emission.”  In 2013, Bo Guangxin, the head of a major Chinese forestry group, estimated that China used 20 million trees to produce roughly 80 billion chopsticks each year, according to The Washington Post.

Fact Check: The CDC uses a mathematical model to retroactively estimate the number of flu-associated deaths during flu seasons, which roughly run from October to March. It looks at both in-hospital death data and death certificates to make the estimate, according to the CDC website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The April 21 post claims that the flu “killed 80,000 people in the U.S. last year,” presumably referencing the 2018-2019 flu season. (RELATED: Did The 2009 Swine Flu Pandemic Kill 18,000 Americans?) But this statistic is inaccurate. The CDC estimated about 34,200 people died from the flu in the 2018-2019 flu season, with the uncertainty interval indicating the range could be as low as about 26,300 and as high as about 52,700 deaths. Mike Patronik, a spokesman for the CDC, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the estimate is preliminary and “may change as data are finalized.” The death figure cited in the post appears to come from the preliminary estimate that the CDC gave in September 2018 for the 2017-2018 flu season. The CDC said at the time that early estimates indicated “more than 80,000 people died from the flu last season.” However, the CDC has since updated its 2017-2018 flu season estimate to a lower number: about 61,000 deaths. That figure, which is still preliminary, has an uncertainty interval ranging from roughly 46,400 to 95,000 flu deaths, according to CDC data.  There have been 24,000 to 62,000 flu deaths in the United States during the 2019-2020 flu season, per a preliminary estimate from the CDC.

Verdict: False This image is a doctored version of a 1987 photo of Trump greeting publisher Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. There is no evidence Trump made the comment attributed to him. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral image purportedly shows a younger Trump shaking hands with bin Laden. The bottom of the image includes a quote, allegedly from Trump, that says, “I knew Osama Bin Laden. People loved him. He was a great man that died for a worthy cause.” (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama And Condoleezza Rice Pose For Photos With Osama bin Laden?) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the image has been digitally manipulated. The original photo, taken in December 1987, actually shows Trump greeting Newhouse at a party in Trump Tower, according to the Getty Images caption. In the manipulated image, Trump’s head has been superimposed onto Newhouse’s, and bin Laden’s has been superimposed onto Trump’s. The comment attributed to Trump doesn’t hold up either. An internet search by the Caller didn’t yield any media outlets attributing it to him, only other fact-checkers debunking it. Nor has Trump ever tweeted it from his verified Twitter accounts.

Fact Check: Honjo, a Kyoto University professor, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2018. He and American researcher James Allison received it “for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation,” per the Nobel Prize website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post cites Honjo as allegedly saying the new coronavirus was engineered in a laboratory in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged in late 2019. “I know the Chinese labs where the virus was perfected,” Honjo is quoted as saying. “Natural viruses are temperature and climate-sensitive. Corona had affected every nation, irrespective of geography, climate and temperature. Had it been natural, it’s spreading would have been limited to Wuhan like places and climate.” He also allegedly added that “if it’s not proven even after my death, take away my Nobel prize,” according to the post. (RELATED: Does This Video Show A Tsunami Hitting China During The Coronavirus Pandemic?) Variations of the claim have been posted in numerous Facebook groups and pages, according to CrowdTangle. There is, however, no truth to it.  Honjo denied making the comments in a statement through Kyoto University on April 27, saying, “In the wake of the pain, economic loss, and unprecedented global suffering caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am greatly saddened that my name and that of Kyoto University have been used to spread false accusations and misinformation.” The claim, debunked by Snopes in April, appears to have stemmed from the Twitter account @TasukuHonjo, which is not affiliated with the Kyoto professor and has been deleted.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Although the exact origins of the new coronavirus remain unknown, experts believe it likely came from bats, CNN reported. Its genetic sequence shares similarities with the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which spread from bats to humans through an intermediary species, according to Nature. Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told the Washington Post that “absolutely nothing” in the genetic sequence indicates the virus was engineered.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3009764385748600&set=a.1753089278082790&type=3&theater,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018/honjo/facts/,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2018/honjo/lecture/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3009764385748600&set=a.1753089278082790&type=3&theater,https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-timeline.html,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3009764385748600&set=a.1753089278082790&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3009764385748600&set=a.1753089278082790&type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/24/fact-check-video-tsunami-hitting-china-during-coronavirus-pandemic/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3009764385748600&set=a.1753089278082790&type=3&theater,https://apps.crowdtangle.com/search/results?platform=facebook&postTypes=&producerTypes=1&q=%22the%20government%20can%20withdraw%20my%20Nobel%20Prize%22%20AND%20%22tasuku%20honjo%22&sortBy=score&sortOrder=desc&timeframe=1month,https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/about/events_news/department/koto-kenkyu-in/news/2020/200427_1.html,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nobel-laureate-tasuku-honjo-covid/,https://twitter.com/TasukuHonjo,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/us/coronavirus-scientists-debate-origin-theories-invs/index.htmlhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/us/coronavirus-scientists-debate-origin-theories-invs/index.html,https://www.nature.com/nature/about,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/16/tom-cotton-coronavirus-conspiracy/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3a4e485f4c55487a5e5b535643595b56565f4814595557",Did Nobel Laureate Tasuku Honjo Say The Coronavirus Was Engineered In A Chinese Lab?,,,,,

Besides New York, no state has reported over 200,000 cases to date. Fact Check: The new coronavirus has sickened more than 1.5 million people and killed some 93,000 others in the U.S. at the time of publication, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. A viral May 17 Facebook post falsely alleges that 220,000 of those cases were recorded in the coastal city of Myrtle Beach in 72 hours, saying, “All y’all gone (sic) die.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Had the city reported 220,000 new coronavirus cases in 72 hours, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) has also not announced a spike in cases to that effect to the media, nor has it put such numbers on its “SC Testing Data & Projections (COVID-19)” webpage. As of roughly 6 p.m. on May 20, the state has reported nearly 9,200 positive cases of COVID-19, according to the SCDHEC website. South Carolina had just over 8,900 positive cases on May 17, the date the claim was made. There were just over 300 positive coronavirus cases in Horry County, where Myrtle Beach is located, on May 17, according to the SCDHEC website.

84,,,,False,,,,checkyourfact,,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/20/fact-check-flu-vaccines-people-test-positive-coronavirus/,Viral Post Claims Flu Vaccines Can Make People Test Positive For COVID-19,2020-05-20,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: Viral Post Claims Flu Vaccines Can Make People Test Positive For COVID-197:03 PM 05/20/2020Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsAn image shared on Facebook claims that people who have received flu vaccines in the past three to five years will “probably test positive” for COVID-19.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Medical experts refute the claim, and the Food and Drug Administration hasn’t observed any instances in authorized tests to date. Flu vaccines do not contain the new coronavirus. Fact Check: The screen-grabbed Facebook post attributed the claim to an unidentified doctor whom the individual spoke to “this afternoon.” It attempts to use the dubious information to explain why some people test positive without exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “If you have had a flu shot in the last 3-5 years, you will probably test positive,” the doctor is quoted as saying. “Coronavirus antibodies have been in the vaccines since H1N1.” SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a new coronavirus that first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late in 2019. Coronaviruses are distinct from influenza viruses. “There are 4 coronaviruses that cause common cold like symptoms and account for 10-30% of common colds,” Dr. Warner Greene, professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology at the University of California, San Francisco, said in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “To my knowledge, these coronaviruses have not been incorporated into the seasonal flu vaccines.” Flu shots contain either inactivated flu viruses or a single gene from a flu virus to produce an immune response without causing infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Dr. John Sanders, chief of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health, told AFP Fact Check the claim that flu shots make people test positive for COVID-19 was “unsubstantiated rubbish.” (RELATED: Did The Kaiser Permanente CEO Die Just Days After Getting A Flu Shot?) “Both the molecular (viral detection) tests and the serological (antibody) tests have been and are being validated and have demonstrated no cross-reactivity with antibodies generated from previous influenza vaccines,” he told AFP Fact Check.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) told FactCheck.org that all FDA-authorized COVID-19 tests are specifically checked for cross-reactivity with influenza virus or influenza antibodies. There has been no such cross-reactivity observed for any of the tests to date, the spokesperson said, according to FactCheck.org. Other posts have falsely claimed that anyone who was vaccinated for the flu within the last 10 years will likely test positive for COVID-19. These claims appear to stem from a video interview with anti-vaccine advocate Dr. Rashid Buttar, who made a similar claim, Reuters reported. The CDC noted on its website that “there is no evidence that getting a flu vaccine increases the risk of getting COVID-19.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: The picture, found through a reverse image search, comes from a series of photographs that Life magazine photographer Lee Balterman took in 1969. The caption reads, “Class leader Hillary Rodham of Wellesley College talking about student protests which she supported in her commencement speech.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969, and excerpts from her commencement address were featured in the June 20 issue of Life magazine that year, along with photos of student speakers. Only one of Balterman’s photos of Clinton appeared in the issue, but others – including the one in the Facebook post – were later published, according to Life. There is, however, no Confederate flag in the original image, indicating that version shared on Facebook has been digitally manipulated. Other photos from the same collection also show no Confederate flag in the bookcase behind Clinton. (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton Say, ‘If I’m Indicted, I’ll Take Half Of DC With Me’?) This isn’t the first time Clinton has been the subject of a doctored photo. In late 2019, the Daily Caller debunked an image that was manipulated to make it look like she had been photographed shaking hands with former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The image has been digitally manipulated to make Ferrer look ill. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Ferrer has given daily press briefings as Los Angeles County continues to navigate the coronavirus pandemic. As of 8 p.m. on May 19, the county has documented more than 39,500 coronavirus cases, according to the Los Angeles County Public Health Department website. Multiple Facebook users recently shared a photo of Ferrer looking unwell at one such press conference. Twitter users, including conservative political commentator Dinesh D’Souza, also circulated the photo. The image, however, has been digitally altered. Dark circles have been added to her eyes, and her skin has been made pale. (RELATED: Do Only Viruses Made In Laboratories Require Vaccines?) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found a similar but unedited photo in a Deadline article about a press conference she gave on May 13. In footage from that press conference, Ferrer appears to be in good health and wearing the same clothes as those in the doctored image.  D’Souza later said he got “carried away with this one” after another Twitter user pointed out that he tweeted the manipulated image. Ferrer apologized at the May 13 press conference for creating confusion about stay-at-home order restrictions in previous remarks, saying, “I had no intention of messaging that we weren’t changing our order to reflect our recovery journey.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A spokesperson confirmed he has never served on its board or worked for the foundation. Fact Check: Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become a popular target for misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic. In this case, the viral post attempts to link Fauci to the Clinton Foundation, claiming he sat on its board of directors for two decades.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Whoa! Dr Fauci was on Clinton Foundation Board for 20 yrs?” reads the post. “Currently serves on Gates Foundation? #InvestigateFauci.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Bill Gates And Anthony Fauci Violating Social Distancing Guidelines) Had Fauci ever sat on the Clinton Foundation’s board, it would have been noted in media reports, yet none have done so. The foundation also does not have him listed as a current board member, nor has it ever put out press releases announcing that he joined or left the board. Nonprofit organizations must file Form 990s annually with the Internal Revenue Service to maintain their tax-exempt status. Fauci is not listed as a member of the board in any of the Clinton Foundation’s Form 990s between 1998 and 2018, the most recent year available. “Dr. Fauci has never served on our board or worked for the Clinton Foundation,” a Clinton Foundation spokesperson confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller.  The Caller previously reported that Fauci had done some work with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in the past, such as sitting on a board with other experts to help the foundation with its work “in AIDS, malaria, and other diseases” in 2003 and joining the leadership council for the Decades of Vaccines Collaboration in 2010. However, his name does not appear among the members of the leadership team on the Gates Foundation’s website. Nor is he part of its Scientific Advisory Committee.

Kennedy Jr., the son of former President John F. Kennedy.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False While FBI records released in 2000 detail at least three kidnapping threats against John F. Kennedy Jr., there is no evidence Biden was involved in these plots or any others. Fact Check The viral post cites “declassified FBI files” as its source for the claim that Biden was involved in a plot to kidnap John F. Kennedy Jr. at some point.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Associated Press obtained 162 records from the FBI through a Freedom of Information Act request in 2000. Those records, which appear to be referenced in the Facebook post, show that John F. Kennedy Jr. was the target of at least three kidnapping threats during his lifetime. One threat occurred in 1972, when he was in elementary school. The others occurred in 1985, two years after he graduated from Brown University, and in 1995, four years before he died in a plane crash at the age of 38, according to the FBI records. Many of the details surrounding the kidnapping plots are redacted, but none appear to indicate Biden had involvement in any of them. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Leak The Identities Of SEAL Team 6?) Biden is mentioned in the FBI records as a “victim,” according to the Los Angeles Times. In August 1994, the then-senator received a threatening letter from Worcester, Massachusetts, that began, “Dear Sen. Biden, You are a traitor.” It was signed, “John F. Kennedy Jr.”  The FBI analyzed the handwriting and pulled fingerprints from the letter, but eventually closed the case without identifying any suspects, according to the Los Angeles Times. Jim Ellis, a former FBI agent and certified fraud examiner, told In Touch that he does not believe John F. Kennedy Jr. sent the letter to Biden.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “The FBI investigates these [types] of things all the time and 99 percent are from cranks,” he told In Touch. “If somebody really means to do harm to a senator or congressman, they typically don’t telegraph their intentions.” The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any credible reports online that Biden was ever involved in a plot to kidnap John F. Kennedy Jr. either. Biden’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

She had public appearances in Washington, D.C., on the day the post alleges she was there. Fact Check: Multiple Facebook users have shared posts claiming Pelosi was in the central Chinese city of Wuhan six days after the Senate acquitted Trump on two articles of impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, on Feb. 5.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Pelosi was in Wouhan (sic) China 6 days after the impeachment HOAX failed,” reads one such post. “Has anyone bothered to find out what she was doing there?” (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Divert $2.4 billion From Social Security To Pay For Impeachment?) Had Pelosi traveled to China at that time, major media outlets would have reported on it, yet none did so. Members of Congress must also file expenditure reports for official foreign travel with the House Clerk’s office, and the foreign travel reports for the first quarter of 2020 show no record of Pelosi traveling to China. Pelosi made at least two public appearances in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 11, the day she was allegedly in China. She held a joint press conference with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and took photos with Democratic Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, according to press releases. This is not the first time social media users have claimed Pelosi was in Wuhan, the city where the new coronavirus first emerged in late 2019. Last month, other fact-checkers debunked a viral post that alleged she had traveled there in November 2019.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The German newspaper Bild actually created the mock invoice. Fact Check: The viral image shows side-by-side photos of Chinese President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, along with a headline saying, “Germany sends China £130billion bill for ‘coronavirus damages’ – sparks fury in Beijing.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the pictured headline is misleading. The German newspaper Bild actually created an itemized invoice based on its calculations of economic losses incurred by Germany during the coronavirus pandemic. In total, the mock bill amounted to 149 billion euros, or roughly 130 billion pounds, according to Germany-based DW News. The headline came from a Daily Express article published on April 21, though it has since been changed. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Beijing And Shanghai Haven’t Had Any Coronavirus Cases) “This article was originally headlined ‘Germany sends China £130billion bill for ‘coronavirus damages’ – sparks fury in Beijing,'” reads the Daily Express’s clarification. “In fact it was not the German Government that estimated the bill for the Coronavirus (that should be paid by China) but rather the leading German news publication Bild.” The Chinese Embassy in Berlin refuted the claims in the mock invoice in a statement addressed to Bild’s editor-in-chief, saying it fuels “nationalism, prejudice and xenophobia,” according to a translation.  German Minister of Foreign Affairs Heiko Mass has also said the idea of billing China for damages is “illusory,” according to Full Fact.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Reade has accused former Vice President Joe Biden of sexually assaulting her while she worked in his Senate office in 1993. Biden and his campaign have denied the allegation.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Social media users have since shared side-by-side photos of Reade and a woman who appeared on “Dr. Phil,” claiming they are the same person based on a supposed physical resemblance. This particular post reads, “Did some research on Tara Reade Check this out, SHE was ‘Jennifer’ on Dr. Phil in Love with Putin!! Here is the phots (sic), same earrings YEARS later!!” However, the woman is not Reade. Douglas Wigdor, Reade’s attorney, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that they are different people, and a “Dr. Phil” spokesperson also told The Associated Press, “All guests are fully vetted and that is not Reade.” Jennifer, who was only identified with her first name on the show, appeared in an episode of “Dr. Phil” last year. She claimed to be in a romantic relationship with Putin despite never having met him. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Joe Biden Posing With Tara Reade?) “My mother thinks she is in a relationship with Vladimir Putin to the extent that she has become homeless, living in and out of motels,” the woman’s daughter said during the episode. “My mother says Putin is going to make her the queen of Russia to help run his country.”  Social media posts have included clips from the “Dr. Phil” episode in an attempt to reduce Reade’s credibility, according to The Associated Press.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=662923387889665&set=a.124546581727351&type=3&theater,https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/27/joe-biden-accused-of-sexually-assault-tara-reade/,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-morning-joe.html,https://www.drphil.com/videos/my-mom-is-homeless-and-believes-she-is-engaged-to-putin/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=662923387889665&set=a.124546581727351&type=3&theater,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8890880022,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11021932/,https://www.drphil.com/videos/my-mom-is-homeless-and-believes-she-is-engaged-to-putin/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/11/fact-check-photo-joe-biden-posing-tara-reade-zoe-baird/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cokCPtSKdLs,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8890880022,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#41353324372e33012520282d3822202d2d24336f222e2c",Did Tara Reade Say She Was In Love With Vladimir Putin On ‘Dr. Phil’?,,,,,

Brian Kemp posing with Gregory McMichael, who has been charged along with his son for the murder of Ahmaud Arbery.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The photo shows Kemp posing with James Stachowiak, whom the Council on American-Islamic Relations called a “violent anti-Muslim extremist.” Fact Check: Gregory McMichael and his son Travis McMichael were recently charged with murder and aggravated assault for the February shooting death of Arbery, an unarmed young black man, in Brunswick, Georgia. The charges came after footage of the shooting circulated on social media, prompting a national outcry for action on the case.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which features an image of the governor posing with a man wearing an “Allah is not God” shirt, attempts to link Kemp to the elder McMichael. “Ahmaud Arbery’s Killer Gregory McMichael sling (sic) side GA’s Governor Brian Kemp,” the caption partly reads. “Kemp says he wants to bring justice to Ahmaud’s family … yeah okay!” (RELATED: Were These Trees Cut Down To ‘Make Way For 5G’?) But the man pictured with the governor is not McMichael. When the photo of the man is compared to McMichael’s publicly available mugshot, that fact becomes clear. Former police officer Gregory McMichael, 64, poses for a booking photo after he and his son were arrested by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and charged with murder in the shooting death of unarmed black man Ahmaud Arbery, in Brunswick, Georgia, U.S. May 7, 2020. Picture taken May 7, 2020. Glynn County Sheriff?s Office/Handout via REUTERS. The Daily Caller News Foundation ran a reverse image search and found the photo in a 2018 article from local Georgia outlet WXIA. The article, titled “Kemp distances himself from ‘extremist’ supporter wearing ‘Allah is not God’ shirt,” identifies the man as Stachowiak.  Kemp faced criticism for the photo after it surfaced during his gubernatorial campaign in 2018. He denied knowing Stachowiak, saying to reporters, “On these bus tours you can see (supporters) take hundreds of pictures you know – sometimes a day — and I certainly don’t agree with his extreme views,” according to WXIA.

Fact Check: The video, purportedly taken in Saudi Arabia, shows people riding horses slowly down a street while vehicles with flashing lights follow behind them. The caption, roughly translated from Indonesian, says, “Praise be to Allah… Saudi Arabia has opened this lockdown meaning Saudi Arabia is safe from Covid (sic).”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Saudi government partially lifted its nationwide curfew from April 26 until May 13 between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., except for in Mecca and other areas with high numbers of COVID-19 infections, according to Newsweek. It has since announced it will re-imposed the countrywide 24-hour curfew, starting May 23 through May 27, Reuters reported. The footage does not show people celebrating in Saudi Arabia. Through a reverse image search of key frames, the Daily Caller found the footage in a longer video posted on YouTube in late April. That video’s title says, “Dubai celebrating zero corona cases,” while its caption reads, “Celebrating zero corona cases, after opening the Naif area in Dubai,” according to a translation. Signage for Mega Star Nutrition and Tide Dry Cleaners and Laundry visible in the video matches that near the intersection of 27th Street and Al Maktoum Hospital Road in Naif neighborhood of Dubai on Google Maps. (RELATED: Does The Australian Government’s COVIDSafe App Track Users’ Locations?)

Fact Check: The post, which has been shared more than 1,800 times, features a photo of a man with a mask on his face and zip ties on his wrists. Other mask-wearing individuals in the background appear to be following behind him.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Republic of Guinea have arrested all Chinese living and working in their country and threatened if the Guinea citizens living in China do not return safely, the Chinese in Guinea with face the consequences,” the caption claims. The Chinese Embassy in Guinea debunked in an April 20 statement similar claims that started circulating amid African citizens reporting discrimination under coronavirus mitigation efforts in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. (RELATED: Does This Image Show A Crowded South African Beach During The COVID-19 Lockdown?) “Most recently, some online media have made a fuss about articles and videos on ‘the arrest of Chinese nationals in Guinea by the Guinean government,'” the statement translates. “After verification, it turned out that these are outright lies. We protest with indignation against these ostensible defamations aimed at undermining Sino-Guinean and Sino-African friendship.” The Daily Caller also didn’t find any credible reports of the Guinean government ordering the arrest of all Chinese nationals or issuing such a threat. Nor does the photo featured in the Facebook post appear to have been taken in Guinea or China. Benar News, an outlet affiliated with Radio Free Asia, included the photo in a November 2019 article.  “Indonesian police officers escort Chinese nationals who were arrested on suspicion of involvement in an online scam, at the Jakarta police headquarters, Nov. 26, 2019,” reads the photo’s caption.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/108592344067372/photos/a.108621464064460/133761314883808/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/108592344067372/photos/a.108621464064460/133761314883808/?type=3&theater,http://gn.china-embassy.org/fra/zxxx/t1771608.htm,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-accused-discriminating-against-africans-part-coronavirus-fight-n1183326,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/01/fact-check-image-beach-bloemfontein-south-africa-bondi-australia/,http://gn.china-embassy.org/fra/zxxx/t1771608.htm,https://www.google.com/search?q=Guinea+government+Chinese+nationals&oq=Guinea+government+Chinese+nationals&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61.10769j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/indonesia-scam-11262019164815.html,https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/indonesia-china-11262019144225.html,https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/indonesia-china-11262019144225.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#90e4e2f5e6ffe2d0f4f1f9fce9f3f1fcfcf5e2bef3fffd",Has The Guinean Government Arrested All Chinese Nationals In The Country?,,,,,

One social media user who shared the document claims, “If you test positive for COVID, they can take your kids.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Jake Sunderland, press secretary for the department, told the Daily Caller that the claim “is absolutely untrue,” however. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show California Department Of Social Services Letter About Coronavirus Testing) “This would only be done on a voluntary basis and if the caregiver needed and requested it,” Sunderland said in an email. “We would also work with the caregiver to first identify any potential friends or family that can provide a safe and caring environment for the child before making the decision that entering foster care was necessary. A parent or other primary caregiver having a severe illness, even COVID-19, would never be the sole reason for removing a child in Oregon.” The Oregon Department of Human Services also issued a statement clarifying the policy outlined in the document, saying, “We want to be very clear: DHS Child Welfare in Oregon does not identify a parent’s medical condition as a safety threat and sole reason for removal of children.” The document, which is available online, states, “Again, this value is to be used only when the determination has been made that the child will be entering or has entered substitute care because their caregiver is infected with COVID-19 and is unable to support them.”  This isn’t the first time social media users have claimed state governments can take children away if their parents or legal guardians test positive for coronavirus. The Daily Caller previously debunked a fabricated California Department of Social Services letter made a similar claim.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

There is no evidence that vegetarians fare better than non-vegetarians when it comes to COVID-19 infections. Fact Check: The Facebook post contains several blocks of text, including one with an alleged quote from the WHO’s Dr. Gauden Galea that reads, “As long as people eat meat, there is going to be some risk of infection. Its caption claims that, according to the WHO, no vegetarian has contracted COVID-19 because the coronavirus that causes it “requires animal fat in the body.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But this information is inaccurate. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched the WHO website for any statement about vegetarians but did not find any such announcement. There is also no news reporting about the alleged report. “The WHO has not made such a statement,” Supriya Bezbaruah, the WHO’s India representative, told AFP Fact Check in early May. (RELATED: No, Eating Alkaline Foods Won’t ‘Beat’ Coronavirus) In addition, Galea told The Logical Indian, an Indian news website, that his comments about the risk of eating meat were taken out of context, saying, “The statement was part of a longer discussion about the continued global risk of zoonotic viruses and the potential for ‘spillover’ into human populations. The intent was not to endorse any particular diet nor to condemn any other.” There is no indication that vegetarians fare better or worse than non-vegetarians when it comes to COVID-19 infection. Dr. R.V. Asokan, the secretary general of the Indian Medical Association, told AFP that no medical evidence suggests “that non-vegetarian food is in any way related to covid (sic) death susceptibility.”  The virus spreads “primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes,” according to the WHO. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states on its website that there is “no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.” “Presently, there is no evidence that the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic is carried by domestic food-producing animals, such as chickens, ducks, other poultry, pigs, cattle, camels, horses, sheep, goats, rabbits, guinea pigs or fish,” the Food and Agriculture Administration of the United Nations also said in an April report.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: The U.K. Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport notes in a 5G planning report that 5G signals can be impeded by some objects, including hedges and trees. 5G networks, which have been implemented in numerous countries, provide faster connectivity and download speeds for smartphone users.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post shows a residential street lined with tree stumps, claiming someone “chopped 150 year old trees down to make way for 5G how sick is that.” There is, however, no evidence that the pictured trees were cut down for that reason. The Daily Caller News Foundation conducted a reverse image search and found the photo in an article from the Flemish newspaper Het Nieuwsblad. That article describes how the trees were cut down in Baron Descampslaan, a neighborhood in the Belgian city of Leuven, because they needed to be replaced. Belgian politician Carl Devlies said they needed to be replaced because “some trees were sick, others were crooked, and still others were showing signs of aging,” according to a translation of the article. Hannelore Smitz, the author of the article, told Reuters that he obtained the photo from a resident who was concerned about why the trees had been cut down. The local government has since replaced the trees, according to Reuters. (RELATED: Were Thousands Of Birds Killed By Coronavirus Or 5G Networks In Italy?) 5G is not mentioned at any point in the article, and no media reports could be found to corroborate the Facebook post’s claim. Social media is replete with conspiracy theories related to 5G technology, including those that erroneously link its emergence to the spread of the new coronavirus.

Fact Check: Asian giant hornets, known to decimate bee colonies, are the world’s largest species of hornets. They were sighted in the U.S. for the first time in December 2019, when the Washington State Department of Agriculture verified two reports near the Canadian border, according to The Associated Press.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral Facebook post falsely alleges in an image that 3,000 “murder hornets” were found dead in South Carolina, despite no there being no confirmed sightings outside Washington to date. (RELATED: Can Houseflies Spread COVID-19?) Anne Lebrun, national policy manager for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Honeybee and Pollinator Pest Programs, told AFP Fact Check that “neither USDA nor WSDA has any evidence that Asian giant hornet populations are established in Washington State or anywhere else in the United States.” Ben Powell, a statewide apiculture and pollinator specialist at Clemson University, also told WIS News 10 that the likelihood of Asian giant hornets migrating to South Carolina is “pretty low because they would have to traverse a bunch of different ecosystems.” “Especially in the middle of the COVID-19 situation, when people are already antsy, a bunch of scary talk about an invasive species naturally will make them nervous,” Brad Cavin, the chief apiary inspector for the Department of Plant Industry based at Clemson University, said in an interview with The Newsstand. “But right now this hornet is approximately 3,000 miles from South Carolina. The only confirmations we have in North America are from Washington State near the Canadian border in December 2019 and from Vancouver, British Columbia, in August 2019.”  Facebook posts claiming that Asian giant hornets have been found in other states such as Illinois, Texas and Louisiana have also circulated in recent weeks, AFP Fact Check reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A post shared by  Welcome to my other world (@bigslimm7) on Apr 12, 2020 at 1:18pm PDT     googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) states the payments “will not reduce your refund or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 Federal income tax return.” Fact Check: President Donald Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act on March 27. Included in the bill are “economic impact payments” that amount to $1,200 payments for single adults that have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less and $2,400 payments for married couples that earn $150,000 or less, as well as $500 payments for qualifying dependents under the age of 17, according to The New York Times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The video, which originated on TikTok but has also surfaced on Facebook and Instagram, claims recipients will have to pay the federal government back when they file their 2020 tax returns. “So that means next year, you’re automatically going to owe $1,200 come tax season,” the man in the video says. “Guys, stay safe out there. Media and public is not telling you exactly what this bill is.” The payments are refundable advance tax credits but, according to the IRS and the Tax Foundation, that does not mean they must be paid back. It is similar to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit in that it doesn’t need to be repaid, per CNBC. (RELATED: No, Coronavirus Stimulus Payments Are Not Tied To The 2020 Census) “The Payment is not includible in your gross income,” the IRS states on its website. “Therefore, you will not include the Payment in your taxable income on your Federal income tax return or pay income tax on your Payment.

Fact Check: The claim about how to prevent and cure human viruses comes as researchers around the world race to develop a vaccine against the new coronavirus. It has been shared on Facebook and Instagram thousands of times, according to The Associated Press.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Any virus that originated from nature has its remedy & cure from nature,” reads a popular iteration of the claim. “ONLY VIRUSES made in laboratories require vaccines.” (RELATED: Did 7 Children Die After Being Vaccinated For Coronavirus In Senegal?) Human viruses such as polio, measles and rotavirus have all originated in nature and have no specific antiviral treatment, according to the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. Preventing infection through the use of vaccines has been the most effective means to combat such diseases and reduce their death rates around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) states on its website. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Center for Infection and Immunity at the Columbia University School of Public Health, also told the Daily Caller in an email, “No viral pathogen for which we have vaccines were made in a lab.” “To say that any virus that originated from nature has its remedy in nature, ignores the fact that all human viruses came from nature, and that we have made vaccines for many of them,” Vincent Racaniello, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, told The Associated Press. “I am unaware of any remedy from nature that prevents infection with any human virus.”  No vaccine against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is currently available, though a number of candidates are currently undergoing clinical trials, according to the WHO.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=253497622445846&set=a.103913310737612&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=253497622445846&set=a.103913310737612&type=3&theater,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8816350122,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=253497622445846&set=a.103913310737612&type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/27/fact-check-seven-children-die-vaccinated-coronavirus-senegal/,https://www.britannica.com/science/virus,https://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/history-polio-poliomyelitis,https://www.historyofvaccines.org/index.php/content/articles/measles,https://www.historyofvaccines.org/index.php/content/articles/rotavirus,https://www.collegeofphysicians.org/,https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/2/07-040089/en/,https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/center-infection-and-immunity/angela-rasmussen-phd,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8816350122,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/question-and-answers-hub/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#71050314071e03311510181d0812101d1d14035f121e1c",Do Only Viruses Made In Laboratories Require Vaccines?,,,,,

Fact Check: Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates have become popular targets for misinformation amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In this case, multiple Facebook users have claimed Fauci previously sat on Microsoft’s board of directors, with one post saying, “I bet you didn’t know Dr. Fauci sat on MicroSoft’s (sic) Board of Directors – and that Bill Gates – was his boss.” Had Fauci ever joined Microsoft’s board, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it. The company also has not mentioned anything to that effect in a press release, nor has it listed Fauci as a director in any of the annual reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission between 1994 and the present. Microsoft confirmed to The Associated Press that Fauci has not served on Microsoft’s board.

In 2010, Fauci joined the foundation’s leadership council for the Decades of Vaccines Collaboration, which was part of the foundation’s Global Vaccine Action Plan. He was also on a board in 2003 with other experts to help the Gates Foundation with its work “in AIDS, malaria, and other diseases,” according to the press release.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

CNN had published a number of articles about Reade’s allegation by April 29, the day the claim was made. A search for “Tara Reade” on CNN’s website returned 33 news items as of press time.

The claim originated on the satirical news website Bustatroll.org. Fact Check: Social media platforms are replete with misinformation about politicians. In this case, the image, which appears to be a screen grab of an article, alleges that the House speaker has been asked to not attend church until she “finds God and gets help.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “The Archbishop of San Francisco had to personally call on Nancy Pelosi at her home today to ask her to not come to church anymore,” the screen grabbed article partly reads. “The decision, which was made by the local diocese but approved by Papal Decree from Rome, is a step short of excommunication.” (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say, ‘It Is Dangerous To Let The Voters Decide Trump’s Fate’?) Pelosi grew up in a Catholic household and once described herself in a 2008 interview as an “ardent, practicing Catholic.” Although her political stance on abortion is at odds with other Catholics, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no news reporting to corroborate the claim that she has been asked to not attend church. The claim stems from an article published on Bustatroll.org, a satirical news website that often writes fictional stories about Pelosi. The article, published in 2019, contains the same text as the Facebook post, as well as a fabricated statement from Art Tubolls, which appears to be an anagram for the website’s name. Yet, while Bustatroll.org clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, the Facebook post fails to convey a similar warning, giving the impression that the story is real. This is a common way misinformation spreads on the internet. Check Your Fact has debunked several fake news stories about Pelosi that originated as satire on Bustatroll.org.

In 2016, a South African pastor reportedly gave his congregants Dettol, but no one appears to have died in that incident. Fact Check:  The post, which features a picture of a man pouring a red liquid into a woman’s mouth, claims, “59 people die as Pastor gives them dettol to drink in church to prevent Coronavirus in Kenya.” Dettol is a brand of antiseptic cleaning solution. (RELATED: Does This Video Show A Fight Between Kenyan and Chinese Couples In Wuhan?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any media reports about about 59 people dying in Kenya from drinking Dettol in an effort to prevent infection with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Had such an incident occurred, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it, except to debunk it. A reverse image search of the featured photo turned up matches in two South African media reports from 2016. The Daily Sun article, which puts up the headline “From Pastor Doom To Pastor Disinfectant,” reports that “Prophet Rufus Phala of AK Spiritual Christian Church made his church members drink Dettol, claiming they will be healed (sic) sickness.” The South African outlet Eyewitness News also wrote about the incident in December 2016 and used the same image as that in the Facebook post. Dettol South Africa released a statement addressing the incident at the time, saying, “Dettol Antiseptic Liquid is not for human consumption and is for external use only, and we condemn the reported usage as inappropriate.”   The statement went on to say Dettol South Africa has “been in contact with Prophet Rufus Phala” and has “asked him to stop this practice.” Anyone who consumes Dettol should see a doctor, the company also advised in the statement. No media outlets reported that congregants died in the 2016 incident. The claim appears to stem from a March 19 article published on the website Kenya Today. That article, titled “59 people die as Pastor gives them dettol to drink in church to prevent Coronavirus,” alleges Phala gave his congregants Dettol to prevent COVID-19 infection. But a spokesperson for the South African Police Service told AFP Fact Check that the claim was false and “denied any investigations into the deaths of 59 people linked to the consumption of Dettol,” according to the outlet.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends, among other measures, practicing social distancing and wearing face coverings in public to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. (RELATED: Does A Bill Gates-Funded Research Institute Own The Patent For Coronavirus?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post falsely alleges in an image that Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Gates are pictured violating those recommendations. The caption reads, “No social distancing or masks for these two demons who are shutting down an entire planet.” Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found the original photo on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) website. The photo, taken in December 2018, also shows NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins, who has been cropped out of the Facebook version, and can be found on the NIH’s Flickr account. “The NIH teamed up with the Bill Gates and Melinda Gates Foundation to hold their fifth annual consultative workshop on global health,” reads the description on the NIH’s Flickr account. “The workshop took place on December 11, 2018 in Bethesda, MD. Some of the topics discussed were a universal flu vaccine, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and maternal, neonatal and child health.” The photo was taken roughly a year before the new coronavirus was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. As of press time, the virus has since sickened more than 4.3 million people and killed some 295,000 others worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Gretchen Whitmer Violating Social Distancing Guidelines?3:39 PM 05/13/2020Jonathan Fonti | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsAn image shared on Facebook purportedly shows former Vice President Joe Biden and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer violating social distancing guidelines on April 9.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The photos, taken in September 2018, show the two politicians at a gubernatorial campaign event for Whitmer. Fact Check: Whitmer has faced criticism from President Donald Trump and Michiganders for instituting some of the nation’s strictest stay-at-home orders in response to the coronavirus pandemic, according to NBC News.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post uses two photos – one of Biden and Whitmer standing side-by-side and one of them walking in a parking lot with Garlin Gilchrist, Michigan’s lieutenant governor – to criticize and question Whitmer’s orders. It claims that the pictures, purportedly taken on April 9, show Biden and Whitmer violating social distancing guidelines. “HERE’S..why we shouldn’t believe her..for one minute.. and why follow her demands either,” remarks the Facebook user. “She herself should be ticketed and arrested for violating a Executive order.. This is known as.. ‘Do as I say’ but not ‘Do as I Do’ .. by our Governor.” The photos, however, were actually taken in September 2018, when Biden was campaigning for Whitmer and Gilchrist, her then-running mate. (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Joe Biden Endorsing Donald Trump) Photographer Kathleen Galligan took the picture of Biden, Whitmer and Gilchrist walking in a parking lot for the Detroit Free Press. It shows them arriving “at Leo’s Coney Island in Southfield on Wednesday, September 12, 2018,” according to its caption.  Whitmer tweeted on March 5 the photo of just her and Biden to announce her endorsement of Biden and her new role as a co-chair on his campaign. In the photo, she and Biden appear to be wearing the same clothes shown in the Detroit Free Press photo. Her office confirmed to The Associated Press that it was also taken at that event. Biden has been campaigning from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, since March 12, according to CBS News. Before that, he visited Michigan while campaigning for the state’s March 10 Democratic presidential primary.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The letter, which bears the California Department of Social Services letterhead and the California Health and Human Services secretary’s signature, started circulating widely on social media over the weekend.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Participants “in state assistance benefits, including cash aid, Cal Fresh and MediCal,” must get COVID-19 testing for all members of the household by June 1 or face “temporary suspension of your benefits beginning July 1,” according to the letter. It also claims that, if someone tests positive, the “Humans Services Agency of Merced County may deem it necessary to remove all children [under the age of 18] from your household who have tested negative.” The California Department of Social Services debunked the letter on its website, saying, “The letter, its contents, and the website are fake.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Kentucky Teachers Will Conduct ‘Bedroom Inspections’ For Students) “State departments and county human services departments NEVER will ask about your health status in connection to an application for benefits,” the department said on its website. “Similarly, children must be subject to abuse or neglect to enter foster care. Children cannot be put into foster care just because a parent may be ill.” Merced County and the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office have also issued warnings about the fake letter on Facebook.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, “Jesus was a lot like Trump, both con artists.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence Ocasio-Cortez ever made this remark. The claim stems from a satirical article. Fact Check: Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman to be elected to Congress, is a popular target for online misinformation. In this case, the Facebook post credits her with a comparison between President Donald Trump and Jesus, quoting her as saying, “Jesus was a lot like Trump, both con artists.” (RELATED: Did Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Say, ‘There Are Homeless People Out There Who Can’t Pay Their Mortgage’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is, however, no record of Ocasio-Cortez ever making the remark. Searching her social media posts and press releases yielded no results, and resources like the congressional record didn’t have any matches either. Had the congresswoman made such a comment, it would have been picked up by the media, yet none have reported on it, except to debunk the attribution. The quote appears to come from the headline of an article published on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” But the Facebook post fails to disclaim that the quote is fictitious. Check Your Fact has previously debunked quotes attributed to Ocasio-Cortez. In late March, a viral Facebook post falsely credited the congresswoman with saying, “There are homeless people out there who can’t pay their mortgage,” for instance.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It originated on a satirical website. Fact Check: The claim that Trump sent Obama a $214 million bill for vacations that weren’t “official state business” has been circulating online since at least 2017, with this particular post having been shared over 63,000 times to date.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “PRESIDENT TRUMP JUST ENDED THE OBAMA’S VACATION SCAM! Ex-President Obama was going to stick us for $2.1 billion or so. Before Obama left office, he arranged with the State Department for a series of ‘official visits’ to foreign countries spanning the next 20 years,” the post partly reads. “Using funds from the Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations, Obama was planning to use what would have been $2.1 billion in free vacations for him and up to 24 members of his family plus staff and even a dog sitter until the year 2036.” The post further claims that Trump recalled Secret Service agents protecting the Obama family on such trips and that Obama took 692 days of vacation while in office. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show House Democrats Vacationing In Italy?) There is no truth to the story or its claims, however. The viral post lifts nearly word-for-word from a satirical article published in February 2017 on the website The Last Line of Defense. That now-defunct website disclaims, “All articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney.” During his eight years in office, Obama took 29 vacation trips that spanned all or part of 235 days, as well as 39 trips to Camp David that totaled all or part of 93 days, according to CBS News White House reporter Mark Knoller. Judicial Watch, a conservative government watchdog group, estimates that the Obama family’s travel, including official government business, cost around $114 million, according to records obtained from the Secret Service and Air Force.  The “Office of Presidential Visits and Vacations” does not exist.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any record of countries using mass sea burials for deceased coronavirus victims. Fact Check: The video shows bodies washing ashore on an unidentified coastline and includes text that reads: “Some countries throw Covid19 (sic) infected dead bodies into the seas. Advice to stop eating seafood. The world is really coming to an end. Dead God, please intervene.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Through a reverse image search of key frames, the DCNF found the video posted on the YouTube channel of Euronews. The footage shows bodies of migrants that washed up on a Libyan beach in August 2014, according to its caption. “Amid tragic scenes on a Libyan beach, bodies of would-be migrants have been washed ashore,” the caption partly reads. “More than 100 have been recovered by the Libyan authorities. They are thought to be from a shipwreck at sea last week.” (RELATED: Do These Photos Show The Bodies Of Pakistani Coronavirus Victims?) Hundreds of thousands of African migrants have attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea in recent years, per the European Council on Foreign Relations. The boats that they use to cross sometimes sink, killing many of those on board. The DCNF didn’t find any media reports about countries using mass burials at sea to dispose of “Covid19 (sic) infected dead bodies.” Iran and some other countries have dug mass graves for the burial of coronavirus victims, according to Business Insider.  This isn’t the first time images depicting the aftermath of a shipwreck have been misattributed amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In late March, Check Your Fact debunked a photo that Facebook users falsely claimed showed dozens of coffins containing Italians who had died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. As of press time, the new coronavirus has killed more than 285,000 people worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Reade, who worked for Biden as a Senate staffer in 1993, has accused the then-senator of kissing her, touching her and penetrating her with his fingers without her consent.

A spokesperson from South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) confirmed the claim is “not true.” Fact Check: South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced in late April a 500 billion rand ($26 billion) coronavirus stimulus package that includes 40 billion rand for unemployment benefits and 50 billion rand for social grants, according to Reuters. SASSA administers social grants to “help improve standards of living in society and are given to people who are vulnerable to poverty and in need of state support,” according to the SASSA website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post alleges that white South Africans have been barred from receiving such government aid, despite skin color not being listed as a requirement. (RELATED: Did South African President Cyril Ramaphosa Order All Foreigners To Vacate The Country By June 21 Due To COVID-19?) Applicants seeking Social Relief of Distress grants must be: above the age of 18, unemployed, not receiving any income, not receiving any social grant, not receiving any employment insurance benefit and ineligible to receive such benefit, not receiving a stipend from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and not a resident in a government-funded or subsidized institution, according to the South African government’s website. “This is not true,” Kgomoco Diseko, senior manager of media relations for SASSA, confirmed to Africa Check. “It’s actually unconstitutional.” The claim appears to stem from an article published on the website ANC Sanctioned Genocide.

The chief medical examiner for the county said the claim had “no truth.”  Fact Check:  The post, which has been shared more than 2,900 times, does not offer any source for its claim that over 13 people died in a 48-hour time span in Tucson from “dirty heroin.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports about more than a dozen people in Tucson dying from “dirty heroin” in the same 48-hour period, however. Had such an incident happened, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it. The Tucson Police Department and Pima County Sheriff’s Office haven’t put out any press releases about the alleged deaths either. A spokesperson for the Tucson Police Department told the Caller via email that the department was familiar with the “social media post going around” but was “not notified of that.” (RELATED: ‘Every Week, 300 Of Our Citizens Are Killed By Heroin’) “I’m not finding anything on our side to corroborate that story,” Marissa Hernandez, a spokeswoman for Pima County Sheriff’s Office, said in an email to the Caller. She also added that their homicide unit supervisor “is unaware of anything like that occurring in our jurisdiction.” Dr. Gregory Hess, the chief medical examiner for Pima County, where Tucson is located, told the Caller via email, “No truth to [the] claim and no, never had an instance of 13 people dying from heroin in 48 hours that I am aware of.”  The Arizona Department of Health Services reported 247 verified opioid overdoses in April, with 31 of those overdoses coming from heroin. More than 5,200 people are suspected to have died from opioids in Arizona from June 15, 2017, to May 8, 2020, according to the department’s website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The full C-SPAN video shows that Pence delivered full boxes and did not touch or pretend to deliver the empty ones. Fact Check:  Pence helped deliver boxes of PPE from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to the Woodbine Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center in Alexandria, Virginia, on May 7. The delivery was part of a larger FEMA shipment to nursing homes across the country that included 63 million gloves, 13 million medical gowns and 14 million face masks, according to The Hill.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Jimmy Kimmel, the host of the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” late-night talk show, suggested in his May 7 monologue that Pence was caught on a hot mic delivering empty boxes of PPE to that facility. He also shared the clip on Twitter but has since deleted it. In the video, Pence drops boxes at the door of the nursing home and returns to a van, where an unidentified person tells the vice president that the rest of the boxes in the van are empty. Pence can be heard responding, “Can I carry the empty ones? Just for the camera?” “Mike Pence pretending to carry empty boxes of PPEs into a hospital is the perfect metaphor for who he is and what he’s doing: a big box of nothing, delivering another box of nothing,” Kimmel says at the end of the clip. (RELATED: Video Claims To Show Biden Making A Racist Remark) Multiple Facebook users shared the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” video clip with similar claims in the following days. Vice President of Whitman Insight Strategies Matt McDermott and other users also shared the clip on Twitter. The claim that Pence was caught on a hot mic delivering empty boxes of PPE does not hold up, however.  Here’s the full C-SPAN video of the delivery:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The Daily Caller reviewed the entire 29-minute video and found that the viral clip has been edited to remove key context surrounding the delivery. The C-SPAN video shows Pence helping unload boxes of PPE from the van and carrying them to the health care center for several minutes. Pence’s quip about the “empty ones” comes around the 9-minute mark and is greeted with laughter. He then closes the doors to the van and does not pretend to lift or deliver any of the empty boxes to the nursing home, the full video shows. Jon Thompson, Pence’s campaign communications manager, said on Twitter that Pence is “clearly joking.”  This is absolute garbage spread by @JimmyKimmel. Pence is clearly joking about empty boxes & if Kimmel showed the full clip from CSPAN, not the one he selectively edited, you see and hear it. #FakeNews https://t.co/Hy2oc5xhPe https://t.co/5hFsfxKy9J — Jon Thompson (@JonThompsonDC) May 8, 2020  “This is absolute garbage spread by @JimmyKimmel,” he tweeted. “Pence is clearly joking about empty boxes & if Kimmel showed the full clip from CSPAN, not the one he selectively edited, you see and hear it.” Kimmel later tweeted an apology of sorts.  it would appear that @vp was joking about carrying empty boxes for a staged publicity stunt.

Fact Check: Unidentified debris from a crash-site was recovered from a ranch near Roswell in June 1947, with the U.S. Army announcing that it had recovered a “flying disk” but later saying the debris came from a high-altitude weather balloon, according to The Associated Press. In the 1990s, the Air Force released reports that concluded the likely source of the wreckage was a “balloon-launched classified government project designed to determine the state of Soviet nuclear weapons research,” per a Government Accountability Office report.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Conspiracy theories about extraterrestrials, the government and the Roswell incident have circulated ever since. The Facebook post alleges that nine Democratic politicians were born nine months after the incident, in April 1948: former Vice President Al Gore, former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, former President Bill Clinton, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Sen. Diane Feinstein, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and former California Sen. Barbara Boxer. “See what happens when aliens breed with sheep and jackasses,” the image then remarks. “No wonder they support the bill to help illegal aliens.” But, contrary to the post’s claim, none of the politicians listed were born in April 1948. Only two – Gore and Dean – were actually born in 1948, though not in that month. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, here are the the accurate birth dates for each politician:  Gore: March 31, 1948 Hillary Clinton: Oct. 26, 1947 Kerry: Dec. 11, 1943 Bill Clinton: Aug. 19, 1946 Dean: Nov. 17, 1948 Pelosi: March 26, 1940 Feinstein: June 22, 1933 Schumer: Nov. 23, 1950 Boxer: Nov. 11, 1940 Other credible sources confirm the Encyclopedia Britannica’s birth dates for the nine politicians.

Verdict: False The text message is fabricated. A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Health confirmed to the Daily Caller that the COVIDSafe app does not track users’ locations. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Australian government launched on April 26 the COVIDSafe app to help health officials speed up the contact-tracing process and alert Australians who have come in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Since then, multiple Facebook users have shared alleged screen grabs of a text message notification from the app, suggesting it monitors how far people travel from their homes. “The COVIDsafe App has detected you are now +20km from your nominated address,” reads the screen grabbed text message. “Please register your reason for travel by calling 1300 1My Gov (+61 1300 169 468) within 15 minutes of receiving this SMS (10:12am AEST Monday 27 April 2020). Thank you.” Use of the contact-tracing app is completely voluntary. When downloaded, it asks them to provide their mobile number, age range, postal code and name, which can be a pseudonym, according to BBC News. The app does not, however, monitor the locations of its users, as the post suggests. The Australian Department of Health debunked the screen grabbed text message as a hoax on Twitter in late April.

If you have received this message, delete it and do not reply or text/call the phone number provided.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Health confirmed to the Caller in an email that the screen grabbed COVIDSafe notification in the Facebook post is also a “hoax message.” (RELATED: Is The British Government Sending People Fines Via Text For Violating Coronavirus Stay-At-Home Rules?) “The COVIDSafe App does not have any geolocation capability, it does not track your location, only the proximity of your phone to other people’s phones that have downloaded the app. It cannot monitor a person’s location at any time,” the spokesperson said. “The app does not register a person’s home address and it does not share or send any information with anyone, until authorised by the user, if they have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and then only to state and territory health officials involved in contact tracing.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on May 7 a three-step plan for reopening the country’s economy by July, as the government begins loosening social distancing measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19. according to CNN.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157172745171966&set=a.78225341965&type=3&theater,https://www.health.gov.au/news/covidsafe-new-app-to-slow-the-spread-of-coronavirus,https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app#what-covidsafe-is-for,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157172745171966&set=a.78225341965&type=3&theater,https://www.health.gov.au/resources/apps-and-tools/covidsafe-app#what-covidsafe-is-for,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-52476262,https://twitter.com/healthgovau/status/1255385382734233607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVIDSafe?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/FhQfyEXErX,https://twitter.com/healthgovau/status/1255385382734233607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/healthgovau/status/1255385382734233607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/31/fact-check-british-government-fines-text-message-coronavirus/,https://twitter.com/ScottMorrisonMP/status/1258613312801001473/photo/1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/08/australia/australia-coronavirus-reopen-intl-hnk/index.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#790d0b1c0f160b391d181015001a1815151c0b571a1614",Does The Australian Government’s COVIDSafe App Track Users’ Locations?,,,,,

Fact Check: Madagascan President Andry Rajoelina in April launched an herbal drink, Covid Organics, that he has said can prevent and cure COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Two people have now been cured by this treatment,” he said at the launch, urging people to use it as a preventative as well. “This herbal tea gives results in seven days.” Rajoelina also recently promoted the drink on national television, saying it will “change the course of history,” according to The Associated Press. The island nation has 193 confirmed COVID-19 cases and no deaths as of press time. The Malagasy Institute of Applied Research, which researches uses for Madagascar’s traditional medicines, developed the herbal tonic, which has been distributed and sold throughout the country, per BBC News. The label on the bottle does not list its ingredients, but it reportedly derives from artemisia, a plant used in some malaria drugs, according to the AP. The viral Facebook post claims Covid Organics will “wipe out the virus at any stage within a period of six days.” (RELATED: Does Hot Water With Lemon Kill Coronavirus?)  There is, however, no evidence that Covid Organics can prevent or cure COVID-19, and medical experts have been critical of the drink. In response to the launch of Covid Organics, the World Health Organization (WHO) told BBC News in a statement that it does not recommend “self-medication with any medicines … as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.” “The scientific evidence that this is effective has not been proven,” Marcel Razanamparany, the president of Madagascar’s Academy of Medicine, said in a statement. “It’s likely that it could actually harm the health of the population, particularly that of children.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The U.S. National Institutes of Health has also warned against “alternative” remedies such as herbal therapies and teas, noting that there is “no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness.” Both the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated on their respective websites that there is no known cure for COVID-19. Without scientific evidence of Covid Organics’ safety and efficacy in treating or preventing COVID-19, we rate this claim false.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The video shows a comedic skit meant to raise awareness about social distancing. No media reports about the Kenyan government enlisting the Maasai tribe to enforce the country’s curfew could be found online. Fact Check: The Kenyan government has instituted, among other measures, a curfew from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. local time and a requirement that all people wear face masks in public to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus in the country, according to BBC News. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show WHO Lockdown Guidelines) The video shows a man wearing clothing that somewhat resembles the traditional garb of the Maasai tribe. As he swings a whip at several people in the streets of Kenya’s capital city of Nairobi, he shouts, “One meter!” The caption claims the Kenyan government is “employing Maasai tribe in enforcing curfew!”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the caption’s claim doesn’t hold up. Mbuzi Seller, the Kenyan comedian brandishing the whip in the footage, confirmed to France 24 that the video is comedic. Seller actually created the comedic skit to raise awareness about the importance of social distancing. “I saw my fellow Kenyans out in the streets as if nothing was happening. I wondered if they thought that this virus was a joke and so I wanted to make a joke out of it myself, but this time to get people to understand just how serious the situation is,” Seller told France 24 in a statement. “So I used my character to ‘terrify’ the population and encourage them to maintain a distance of one meter from others.” Seller also emphasized that the whip was fake and that he hadn’t been commissioned by the Kenyan government to make the skit, according to France 24. The Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports about the Kenyan government calling upon the Maasai tribe to help enforce the country’s mitigation measures. While the video does not show someone deputized by the Kenyan government to enforce the curfew, Kenyan police have been criticized for using violent methods to do so. At least 12 people in Kenya have been killed by police since the dusk-until-dawn curfew that started on March 27, the Washington Post reported.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/groups/CoronavirusPandemic/permalink/174366116998064/,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52326316,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/21/fact-check-world-health-organization-lockdown-guidelines-fake/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/CoronavirusPandemic/permalink/174366116998064/,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Maasai,https://observers.france24.com/en/20200417-debunked-kenyan-government-not-recruit-maasai-lockdown,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tHAlpUJHmM,https://observers.france24.com/en/20200417-debunked-kenyan-government-not-recruit-maasai-lockdown,https://observers.france24.com/en/20200417-debunked-kenyan-government-not-recruit-maasai-lockdown,https://observers.france24.com/en/20200417-debunked-kenyan-government-not-recruit-maasai-lockdown,https://news.google.com/search?q=%22kenya%22%20AND%20%22coronavirus%22%20AND%20%22curfew%22%20AND%20%22whip%22&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-africa-fierce-enforcement-of-coronavirus-lockdowns-is-stirring-resentment-11585825403,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kenya-coronavirus-curfew-crackdown-death-toll/2020/04/15/740a8c4e-79be-11ea-a311-adb1344719a9_story.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a8dcdacddec7dae8ccc9c1c4d1cbc9c4c4cdda86cbc7c5",Does This Video Show A Member Of The Maasai Tribe Whipping Kenyans Who Violate The Coronavirus Curfew?,,,,,

Fact Check: Bill Gates is one of the richest men in the world and gives generously to charity. He and his wife also founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which, among other things, promotes access to vaccinations around the world.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Multiple Facebook users have claimed that Bill Gates’s former doctor said the billionaire did not vaccinate his own children. One such post includes a screen grab of a 2018 article from the now-defunct Locks News Network that puts up the headline “Bill Gates’ Former Doctor Says Billionaire ‘Refused To Vaccinate His Children.'” That article, however, is incorrect. In an internet search, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no credible news reporting to corroborate the claim, only news outlets debunking it. (RELATED: Is Bill Gates ‘Advocating For Church Gatherings To Never Return’?) Melinda Gates posted on her verified Facebook account in April 2019 that all three of her children have been “fully vaccinated.” “All three of my children are fully vaccinated,” she wrote. “Vaccines work. And when fewer people decide to get them, we all become more vulnerable to disease. As World Immunization Week approaches, let’s listen to science, have honest conversations with each other, and act to protect our children.”  The claim started circulating widely online in 2018 after YourNewsWire, a news website known for sharing misinformation, published a similar article in February of that year, per PolitiFact. YourNewsWire now goes by NewsPunch, and the article is not available on NewsPunch’s new website. “Our editorial standards have changed significantly since we moved to NewsPunch.com in late 2018,” Sean Adl-Tabatabai, the editor-in-chief of the publication, told The Associated Press. “The story was originally published on YourNewsWire.com — the claims made in the article were copied from a blog elsewhere on the web. Since it came to light that the claims we had copied were unreliable and likely false, we removed the story from YourNewsWire and didn’t republish on our new site.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Elizabeth Warren.               View this post on Instagram                     NYT opinion section truly contains more creativity than any art museum on earth  A post shared by  Brad Troemel (@bradtroemel) on Apr 27, 2020 at 9:02am PDT     googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “NYT opinion section truly contains more creativity than any art museum on earth,” reads the caption. Verdict: False There is no record of The New York Times publishing the op-ed. It appears to have been fabricated. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This isn’t the first time The New York Times has been the target of misinformation on social media. Last month, a viral Facebook image falsely claimed that the media outlet had used a photo of coffins from a 2013 shipwreck to illustrate Italy’s coronavirus death toll, for instance. The Instagram post allegedly shows a New York Times article that puts up the headline “Is Kim Yo Jong North Korea’s Elizabeth Warren?” The article, purportedly written by journalist Virginia Heffernan, features a photoshopped image and further asks, “She’s shrewd and powerful but can she be the feminist leader the Hermit Kingdom needs?” There is, however, no record of Heffernan writing the op-ed for The New York Times or any other media outlet. A search of LexisNexis and her more than 1,300 bylines for The New York Times turned up no matches for the alleged article shown in the Instagram post. (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Kim Jong Un’s Funeral) The New York Times opinion section appears to have only published five pieces mentioning Yo Jong, with the most recent titled, “The Ivanka Trump of North Korea? Oh, Please.” Columnist Frank Bruni wrote that op-ed in February 2018.  The fake op-ed started circulating after media reports speculated that the North Korean leader was near death or dead after he missed the April 15 commemoration of the 108th birthday of Kim Il Sung, his grandfather and founder of the country’s dynastic regime. North Korean state media outlet Korean Central News Agency reported on May 1 that Kim had been photographed cutting the ribbon of a new fertilizer plant in a town north of Pyongyang, according to a translation from South Korean Yonhap News Agency.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It predates the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Fact Check: The video, which has been viewed over 49,000 times to date, shows numerous individuals singing the Indian national anthem “Jana Gana Mana,” with the caption claiming it was “put together by USA students to Thank India for supply of Hydroxychloroquine.” (RELATED: No, Eating Papaya Salad Cannot Prevent COVID-19 Infection)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Hydroxychloroquine, the drug officially approved to treat malaria and some autoimmune diseases, has been used in clinical trials for patients suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. India lifted a partial export ban on hydroxychloroquine in early April and has reportedly sent millions of tablets of the drug to the U.S., according to Reuters. But the video was not produced to thank India for supplying the U.S. with hydroxychloroquine. YouTube creator Anisha Dixit actually published the video in August 2017 – roughly two years before the new coronavirus first emerged in China late last year – to celebrate India’s 71st Independence Day. “On the occasion of our 71st Independence day, I wanted to celebrate global freedom and diversity,” reads the video caption. “Unity and diversity is what India is all about and so is this video. Please stand up and let’s celebrate different people from the world singing THE INDIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM.” Indian media outlets reported on Dixit’s national anthem video when it was posted in August 2017.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

No coronavirus vaccine is currently available. Fact Check: The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has sickened more than 3.7 million people and killed some 264,000 others worldwide to date, per the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Nigeria has over 3,100 confirmed cases and over 100 deaths as of Thursday morning, according to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which features numerous photos of pallets being unloaded from an airplane, alleges China recently sent coronavirus vaccines to Nigeria. (RELATED: Has India’s Government Banned People From Posting About COVID-19 On Social Media?) “Coronavirus vaccine just arrived Nigerian International Airport from China,” claims the post. “Against the wishes of the masses Nigerian government wants to force everyone to take this microchips vaccine. Inform your family not to accept any vaccine from the government.” Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found the photos in an article published by the Chinese state-run Xinhua News Agency. The photos, taken at the Kotoka International Airport in Ghana, show Chinese medical supplies that were distributed to 18 African countries, including Ghana and Nigeria, according to their captions. Among the medical supplies donated from China were N95 masks, medical protective suits, goggles and gloves, according to the Chinese embassy in Ghana. The shipment, however, did not contain coronavirus vaccines.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states on its website that there is “currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19.)” In recent weeks, a number of coronavirus vaccine candidates have begun human trials, according to The New York Times.

Verdict: False Democratic lawmakers did not attempt to include a provision banning the Pledge of Allegiance in any of the relief packages. The claim comes from a satirical news website. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Since the first case of the new coronavirus was confirmed in the U.S. in late January, a series of aid packages have been signed into law to bolster the public health response and to help relieve the financial burdens to Americans affected by the pandemic. (RELATED: Did 44 Senators Vote Against Sending Americans Coronavirus Stimulus Payments?) The Facebook post, which features a screen grab of an article titled “Democrats Tried To Slip a Law Banning Pledge of Allegiance Into Aid Package,” alleges House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted to add the provision to one of those aid packages. The screen grabbed article, published March 24 on Bustatroll.org, seemingly references the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, which was signed three days later. But there is no truth to the headline or article. Had Democratic lawmakers made an effort to include a ban on the Pledge of Allegiance in any of the relief bills, the move would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. Bustatroll.org is a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” The screen grab, however, does not show that disclaimer, and the category “Confirmation Bias Fiction For Boomers” has been digitally removed from its place next to the author byline in the article.  President Donald Trump signed into law on April 24 a $484 billion coronavirus relief that allocates more funds for small businesses and hospitals and for COVID-19 testing, according to CNBC.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Johnson announced on Twitter March 27 that he had tested positive for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. He spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care, before being discharged on April 12, according to The Guardian.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The post falsely alleges that the video shows Johnson offering journalists tea after recovering from the disease, with the caption saying, “Some reporters visited the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson who had recovered from his illness … The living room was too small so he had to hold the tea tray and entertain the reporters outdoors.” The video, taken by The Daily Telegraph, actually comes from August 2018, long before the new coronavirus first emerged in China late last year. It shows Johnson, wearing a blue sweater and holding a tray, as he offers tea to reporters waiting outside his home and refuses to answer questions about an op-ed he wrote that month, according to the caption. Johnson argued in that August 2018 column that burqas should not be banned but said it was “absolutely ridiculous” Muslim women chose to “go around looking like letter boxes” and “bank robbers.” He was widely criticized for the remarks.

A virologist confirmed the claim is false. Fact Check: The internet has become replete with supposed preventatives and cures since the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first emerged in China in late 2019. (RELATED: No, Drinking Magnesium Citrate Cannot Prevent Or Cure Coronavirus)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular Facebook post claims “experts have advised, we drink two spoonful (sic) of palm oil every morning to avoid the continuous spread of the virus,” attributing the alleged preventative to the WHO. It then urges users to share the post to “save millions of lives.” The WHO does not list palm oil as a preventative or cure for the new coronavirus anywhere on its website, however. There are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure COVID-19, and while some traditional or home remedies may alleviate symptoms of the disease, there is no scientific evidence they can prevent infection, according to the WHO website. “Palm oil is not going to have a systemic effect,” Dr. Michael Buchmeier, a virologist and associate director of the Center for Virus Research at the University of California, Irvine, told the Daily Caller in an email. “SARS-CoV2 is not an enteric virus – it does not use the gastrointestinal tract as a route of entry. There is nothing magic about this virus. It is a serious respiratory infection, and Palm oil is not a cure or a preventative.” As of press time, the new coronavirus has sickened more than 3.6 million people and killed some 258,000 others worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Gov. Tom Wolf said on April 3 that Pennsylvania residents should wear face coverings any time they leave their homes to help curb the spread of coronavirus. The announcement came the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formally recommended Americans wear face coverings in public.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    More than 29,000 Facebook users recently shared a post claiming people in Pennsylvania face a “$500 Fine and up to 6 Months in Jail if caught in public without mask.” It also claims the penalty went into effect on April 27. (RELATED: Did Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf Mandate Closures For Schools And Workplaces?) But, like many of the claims making the rounds on social media amid the pandemic, there is no truth to it. The Pennsylvania Department of Health recommends wearing a mask in certain situations, like while shopping at essential businesses or while using public transportation. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to suggest that those who do not follow the recommendation will be fined or jailed. “That post is incorrect,” Nate Wardle, press secretary for Pennsylvania’s Department of Health, confirmed in an email to the DCNF. “There is no fine or jail time for not wearing a mask.” Pennsylvania’s stay-at-home order was extended statewide on April 1, requiring all residents to remain in their homes except for essential purposes. Wolf recently announced that 24 of the state’s 67 counties will begin to roll back restrictions starting May 8, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  As of midday May 5, Pennsylvania has more than 50,900 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health website.

Michigan has not taken any formal regulatory action to restrict access. Fact Check: The post, which features photos of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, alleges the bans include “threatening the licenses of doctors and pharmacist.” It has been shared nearly 450 times to date. President Donald Trump and others have touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The drug, officially approved for treating malaria and some autoimmune diseases, can have potentially serious side effects, with some coronavirus patients developing heart issues while taking it, according to the Wall Street Journal.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The governors of New York, Nevada and Michigan have not banned the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients, however. (RELATED: Can Inhaling Hot Air From A Sauna Or Hair Dryer Kill Coronavirus?) On March 23, Cuomo signed an executive order barring pharmacists from dispensing hydroxychloroquine except for an “FDA-approved indication” or for a “state approved clinical trial related to COVID-19 for a patient who has tested positive for COVID-19,” and limiting prescriptions to 14-day supplies. Five days later he amended the order to allow doctors to prescribe the drug for “patients in inpatient settings and acute settings; for residents in a subacute part of a skilled nursing facility; or as part of a study approved by an Institutional Review Board.” Sisolak signed on March 24 an emergency regulation that prohibits doctors in outpatient settings from prescribing and dispensing hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for COVID-19 treatment and limits prescriptions to 30-day supplies to prevent stockpiling, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The regulation does not apply to doctors who order the drugs for COVID-19 treatment in an inpatient setting, according to CNN. Whiter’s administration has not taken any formal action to restrict access to hydroxychloroquine. On March 24, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA) sent a letter to “licensed prescribers and dispensers” that warned them against prescribing the drug “without a legitimate medical purpose.” The letter did not mention any regulatory action related to hydroxychloroquine access.  David Harns, interim communications director at LARA, confirmed to The Associated Press that the drug is not banned in Michigan, saying, “LARA recognizes the ability of prescribers to make proper clinical decisions regarding these drugs, including the need to follow responsible prescribing practices to combat drug hoarding and to prevent unnecessary shortages.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/groups/272550279840169/permalink/902873266807864/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/272550279840169/permalink/902873266807864/,https://www.facebook.com/groups/272550279840169/permalink/902873266807864/,https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a601240.html,https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/493995-nih-panel-recommends-against-use-of,https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-drug-surveillance-specialist-highlights-hydroxychloroquine-risks-11586629800,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/22/fact-check-hot-air-sauna-hair-drying-kill-coronavirus/,https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20210-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency,https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20211-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency,https://nvhealthresponse.nv.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.24-pharmacy-drugs_.pdf,https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-nevada/sisolak-signs-restriction-order-for-2-drugs-1990149/,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/us/malaria-drugs-nevada-trnd/index.html,https://www.michigan.gov/whitmer/0,9309,7-387-90499_90705---,00.html,https://www.michigan.gov/documents/lara/Reminder_of_Appropriate_Prescribing_and_Dispensing_3-24-2020_684869_7.pdf,https://www.michigan.gov/lara/0,4601,7-154-89505-523363--,00.html,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8747601697,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb9f998e9d8499ab8f8a828792888a87878e99c5888486","Have New York, Nevada And Michigan Banned Hydroxychloroquine Prescriptions For COVID-19 Patients?",,,,,

Verdict: False There is no evidence eating papaya salad can prevent COVID-19 infection. A medical expert called the claim “bogus.” Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Social media platforms have become replete with supposed cures and treatments for COVID-19 since the new coronavirus that causes it first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. This particular Facebook post claims that papaya salad, a popular dish in Thailand also known as som tam, can act as a “food vaccine” for COVID-19. Dr. Pornthep Siriwanarangsan, the former director-general of Thailand’s Department of Disease Control, magnified the claim on social media, according to AFP Fact Check. “In papaya salad there is garlic and chili, which are mucolytics that will help protect you from COVID-19,” he said in one video. (RELATED: Can Burning Neem Leaves Prevention Coronavirus Infection?) The Daily Caller didn’t find any scientific evidence that eating papaya salad can prevent COVID-19 infection, however. Neither the World Health Organization (WHO) nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended consuming the dish as a way to protect one’s self from contracting the novel respiratory disease that has killed some 252,000 people worldwide as of press time.  Dr. Thira Woratanarat, an associate professor in Chulalongkorn University’s Department of Preventive and Social Medicine in Thailand, also told AFP Fact Check that the claim was “bogus.” The WHO’s website states that there is no evidence that traditional or home remedies can prevent or treat the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The internet has become replete with misinformation related to the coronavirus pandemic’s death toll in recent weeks. In late April, the Daily Caller debunked a video falsely claiming to show the body bags of Italian coronavirus victims being dumped into a mass grave.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    More than 3,700 Facebook users have shared three images that, per a rough translation of the caption, purportedly show the bodies of Pakistani coronavirus victims in a morgue and during a mass burial. The photos actually show fatalities from a heat wave that killed over 1,100 people in Pakistan in June 2015, however. Agence France-Press photographer Rizwan Tabassum took the left and bottom-right pictures. They show volunteers holding a mass funeral for unclaimed heat wave victims and burying them near the southern port city of Karachi, according to the captions. Photographer Shahzaib Akbert took the top-right picture for the European Pressphoto Agency. (RELATED: Can Mosquitoes Spread Coronavirus ‘From Person To Person’?) “Rescue workers move the bodies of the victims of heatwave at a mortuary in Karachi, Pakistan, 22 June 2015,” reads the caption. “The death toll from a heatwave in Pakistan climbed to nearly 150 on 22 June, health officials said. More than 130 people have died in the southern port city of Karachi where the temperature was over 45 degrees Celsius on the weekend and no relief was expected on Monday, health official Ijaz Afzal said.”  The heat wave put up temperatures as high as 112 degrees Fahrenheit in June 2015, according to Reuters. The new coronavirus didn’t emerge until late 2019, roughly five years after the photos in the Facebook post were taken.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The bulk of the text comes from an op-ed written by an Air Force veteran in the following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Fact Check: The claim that Trump said that “immigrants, not Americans, must adapt” has been circulating online since at least 2019. Multiple Facebook users shared the long quote and attributed it to Trump, with this particular post having been shared more than 23,000 times to date. (RELATED: Are Muslims Barred From Public Office?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks, we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Americans,” the alleged quote continues. Trump purportedly goes on to encourage immigrants to “take advantage of one other great American freedom, ‘THE RIGHT TO LEAVE.'” Though the president has made controversial statements about Muslims and immigrants in the past, there is no record of Trump ever making the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller didn’t find any matching statements in Factbase or on his social media accounts. Had Trump made the comment, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it, except to debunk it. The first few paragraphs actually reference a 2005 political debate of domestic terrorism concerns in Australia during then-Prime Minister John Howard’s term. The remainder of the post comes from U.S. Air Force veteran Barry Loudermilk’s op-ed titled “This is America.

Fact Check: African citizens have reported discrimination under coronavirus mitigation efforts in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. Reports of discrimination include Africans being evicted from their apartments, being tested for coronavirus multiple times without receiving results and being discriminated against in public, according to Reuters.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The video caption appears to reference these tensions, claiming the video shows a “Kenyan couple exchange blows with a Chinese couple in the streets of Wuhan.” The caption is inaccurate, however.

China has denied allegations of discrimination against Africans from U.S. and African officials, NBC News reported.

135,,,,False,,,,checkyourfact,,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/05/04/fact-check-image-pandemic-exactly-every-hundred-years/,Viral Image Claims There Is A Pandemic Exactly Every 100 Years,2020-05-04,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: Viral Image Claims There Is A Pandemic Exactly Every 100 Years9:46 AM 05/04/2020Elias Atienza | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsAn image shared on Facebook more than 500 times claims a pandemic occurs exactly every 100 years.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The image misstates the timeline for three of the four disease outbreaks, and one cannot be considered a pandemic. Other pandemics have occurred more frequently than every 100 years. Fact Check: Some social media users have spread a conspiracy theory on Facebook that suggests pandemics have occurred exactly every 100 years since the 1700s, linking the Great Plague of Marseille to 1720, the cholera outbreak to 1820, the Spanish flu to 1920 and the new coronavirus to 2020.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The World Health Organization defines a pandemic as “the worldwide spread of a new disease.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers a similar definition. (RELATED: Does Every Election Year Coincide With A Disease Outbreak?) But the dates in the image for when these disease outbreaks began, with the exception of one, are inaccurate, and numerous pandemics have occurred outside the 100-year interval the post suggests. The year listed for the Great Plague of Marseille, which killed as many as 126,000 people from 1720 to 1722, is correct, according to Britannica. However, that outbreak was largely limited to France, meaning it doesn’t fit the widely-accepted definition of a pandemic. The first cholera pandemic started in 1817, three years before the date listed in the Facebook post. That pandemic started in India and had spread to the Middle East, Southeast Asia and parts of the Mediterranean by the time it ended in 1823, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Four other major cholera pandemics occurred during that century as well: 1848-1850, 1854-1857, 1865-1867, and 1873-1874.  The post claims the 1918 influenza pandemic, commonly known as the Spanish flu, took place in 1920, but that year doesn’t hold up. The Spanish flu pandemic actually started in 1918, per the CDC website. Over the roughly one year it lasted, the Spanish flu infected around 500 million people and killed some 50 million others worldwide. The new coronavirus was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, but the virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, according to The New York Times. At the time of publication, the new coronavirus virus has infected some 3.5 million people worldwide, per the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  From 2009 to 2010, the H1N1 flu pandemic, commonly known as swine flu, killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people globally, according to the CDC. That puts just 10 years between it and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, further disproving the claim. The post ignores other pandemics that happened between 1720 and the present day, including: The Third Plague Pandemic (1855): killed around 12 million globally The “Asian Flu” pandemic (1957-1958): killed 1.1 million people globally. The H3N2 Flu pandemic (1968): killed 1 million people globally Many pandemics have occurred outside the neat 100-year pattern suggested in the Facebook post, and those that happen roughly 100 years apart are merely a coincidence.

The photo, taken in 2013, actually shows Bondi Beach in Australia. Fact Check: South Africa’s government instituted a three-week national stay-at-home order starting March 27 and later extended it through April 30 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A news chyron that reads “Crowded Beaches In Bloemfontein” appears at the bottom alongside the logo for the South African media outlet SABC News. Bloemfontein, a landlocked city, does not have any coastal beaches. “I’m so disappointed about the people in Bloemfontein,” reads the Facebook caption. “We all on lockdown… And they decide to still go to there beach… And party.” (RELATED: Did South African President Cyril Ramaphosa Order All Foreigners To Vacate The Country By June 21 Due To COVID-19?)

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The video was filmed in Azerbaijan. The Islamic call to prayer has been regularly performed in Spain for decades. Fact Check: The Islamic call to prayer, referred to as the adhān, is performed five times each day at mosques around the world. A muezzin, the member of a mosque specifically appointed for singing the call to prayer, traditionally performs it from atop a minaret, though not all mosques have such a structure. The video shows a man in a minaret performing the Muslim call to prayer in the evening, with the caption claiming it is the “first time in 500 years the adhān was publicly called by a human voice in Spain.” (RELATED: FACT CHECK: Has Poland Refused To Allow The Building Of Mosques?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The mosque in the video is actually located in Balakan, a city in northwestern Azerbaijan. The majority of the country’s population is Muslim. Instagram user Kenan Musaev posted the video in November 2019 and noted in the comments that it “has nothing to do with Spain,” according to AFP Fact Check. Even if the video had been filmed in Spain, this wouldn’t have been the first time in 500 years that the Muslim call to prayer was performed there. The Grand Mosque of Granada, located in the Spanish city of Granada, posted a video of a call to prayer in July 2017, for instance. Another call to prayer could previously be heard in Granada in 2003, The Guardian reported. The Spanish constitution has legally protected freedom of religion and worship since its adoption in 1978.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/warren.dont/videos/2883500135005921/,https://www.britannica.com/topic/adhan,https://www.britannica.com/topic/muezzin,https://www.britannica.com/art/minaret-architecture,https://www.facebook.com/warren.dont/videos/2883500135005921/,https://www.facebook.com/warren.dont/videos/2883500135005921/,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/21/fact-check-poland-mosques-saudi-arabia-churches/,http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/azerbaijan#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&affiliations_year=2010&region_name=All%20Countries&restrictions_year=2016,https://web.archive.org/web/20200414151503/https://www.instagram.com/p/B5EF7iPHs4N/,https://factcheck.afp.com/video-was-filmed-azerbaijan-november-2019,https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mezquita+Mayor+de+Granada/@37.1813966,-3.5919966,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x50e7b3c56168696b!2sMezquita+Mayor+de+Granada!8m2!3d37.1813966!4d-3.5919966!3m4!1s0x0:0x50e7b3c56168696b!8m2!3d37.1813966!4d-3.5919966,https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=1372372772838793&ref=watch_permalink,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/06/spain.gilestremlett,http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/Hist_Normas/Norm/const_espa_texto_ingles_0.pdf,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#35414750435a477551545c594c5654595950471b565a58",Does This Video Show The First Islamic Call To Prayer In Spain In 500 Years?,,,,,

A spokesperson for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said the claim that China is processing hogs and shipping them back to the U.S. is “absolutely false.” Fact Check: WH Group, a Hong Kong-based food processing company, acquired Smithfield Foods in 2013. The Facebook post alleges that Smithfield Foods packages its meat products in China before shipping them back to the U.S for sale.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “I will not buy any more Smithfield meats!!” reads the post. “China bought them out… will be packaged in China!! Anyone else with me??” (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show People In China Tearing Down A 5G Pole To Stop COVID-19) Smithfield Foods has debunked the claim on its website, however. “Smithfield has not, does not, and will not import any products from China to the United States,” the company states. “No Smithfield products come from animals raised, processed, or packaged in China. All our U.S. products are made in one of our nearly 50 facilities across America.” The North Carolina Pork Council poured water on the claim, noting that “the US Department of Agriculture does not allow any pork or pork products to enter our country from China.” A spokesperson for the FDA also said in an email to USA Today that the notion of China slaughtering and processing hogs and shipping them back to the U.S. is “absolutely false.”  According to Reuters, WH Group is a publicly-traded company on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, meaning that anyone can purchase its stock. The Smithfield Foods website asserts that WH Group has shareholders around the world, not just in China. “In fact, WH Group’s shareholders include many large U.S.-based financial institutions,” Smithfield Food says. “It is not a Chinese state-owned enterprise and does not undertake commercial activities on behalf of the Chinese government.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Social media users shared the claim after Smithfield Foods announced on April 12 that their pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, would be closed indefinitely. 634 of the factory’s employees had tested positive for the coronavirus as of April 17, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported. On April 15, Smithfield Food announced it would close its meat-processing plant in Cudahy, Wisconsin, for two weeks and its plant in Martin City, Missouri, indefinitely. A small number of employees at both facilities had tested positive for coronavirus, the company said in a press release.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/john.giglia/posts/10215139109421141,http://www.wh-group.com/c/about.php,https://www.facebook.com/john.giglia/posts/10215139109421141,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/20/fact-check-video-people-tearing-down-5g-pole-china-coronavirus/%20via%20@check_your_fact,https://www.smithfieldfoods.com/madeinusa,https://www.smithfieldfoods.com/about-smithfield/our-operations,https://www.ncpork.org/not-from-china/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/14/fact-check-smithfield-owned-chinese-firm-sells-us-processed-meat/2987004001/,https://www.reuters.com/companies/0288.HK,https://www.smithfieldfoods.com/madeinusa,https://www.smithfieldfoods.com/press-room/company-news/smithfield-foods-to-close-sioux-falls-sd-plant-indefinitely-amid-covid-19,https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/17/smithfield-coronavirus-south-dakota-not-tracking-negative-covid-19-tests-plant/5152603002/,https://www.smithfieldfoods.com/press-room/company-news/smithfield-foods-to-close-two-additional-meat-processing-facilities,https://www.smithfieldfoods.com/press-room/company-news/smithfield-foods-to-close-two-additional-meat-processing-facilities,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#99edebfceff6ebd9fdf8f0f5e0faf8f5f5fcebb7faf6f4",Viral Image Claims Smithfield Foods Packages Meat Products In China Before Shipping Them Back To The US,,,,,

The nation has 128 cases at the time of publication. Fact Check: As of April 30, the new coronavirus has sickened more than 3.2 million people and killed some 233,000 others worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. The WHO declared the coronavirus a global pandemic March 11.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Zero infected in Madagascar all hail King Julian,” claimed an April 16 Facebook post, seemingly referencing the lemur character King Julien from the 2005 animated movie “Madagascar.” (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Mexico Doesn’t Have Any Coronavirus Cases) According to Reuters, the island nation confirmed on March 20 its first three cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. On April 16, the day the claim was made, Madagascar had reported at least 117 COVID-19 cases, per the WHO’s situation report. The country has 128 confirmed cases as of press time, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Andry Rajoelina, the president of Madagascar, has lauded an artemisia plant-based tonic as a preventative and cure for the new coronavirus. In response to the launch of the tonic, the WHO told BBC News in a statement that it does not recommend “self-medication with any medicines… as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.” “There is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure the illness caused by COVID-19. In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume,” the National Institutes of Health wrote in a report about “alternative” remedies.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The country will start reopening on May 1. Fact Check: The South African government instituted a three-week nationwide lockdown beginning on March 27 and later extended it through April 30 in response to the coronavirus outbreak, requiring civilians not to leave their homes except for reasons deemed essential.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post alleges that Ramaphosa announced a significant extension to the lockdown, as well as specific measures concerning foreign nationals in the country. “The government of SOUTH AFRICA is going to add three months of Totally lockdown which will start on 21 June , And president is asking all foreigners to vacate so that the country can left with its only citizens who will be given free food , water , electricity and free rent,” reads the post. “And the president also add that if the foreigners fail to vacate the country they will face great consequences since they will face military soldiers who will be moving door to door to ensure that the country is left with its only citizens.” These claims are false, however. There is no evidence that Ramaphosa has asked foreign nationals to vacate the country. Nor that the lockdown is now set to last until June 21. (RELATED: Is The British Government Sending People Fines Via Text For Violating Coronavirus Stay-At-Home Rules?) No mention of foreign nationals being asked to leave South Africa appears on the South African government’s website, and an internet search yielded no results, except for other media outlets debunking the claim. The country is set to begin gradually reopening May 1, according to Reuters.  Jackson Mthembu, the minister in the presidency, addressed similar rumors via Twitter on April 7.

The new coronavirus first emerged months after Epstein’s death. Fact Check: Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender, was found dead in his jail cell at Manhattan’s Metropolitan Correctional Center from what officials deemed a suicide in August 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges, according to The New York Times. The circumstances surrounding his death remain the subject of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    One image shared on Facebook claims new autopsy reports suggest he actually died from COVID-19, the respiratory virus caused by the coronavirus currently sweeping the globe. The image shows a picture of Epstein with a breaking news chyron underneath that reads, “NYT: Autopsy reports suggest Epstein most likely died from COVID-19.” But the Daily Caller News Foundation found no such report from The New York Times or any other media outlet. No evidence could be found to suggest the allegedly new autopsy report exist. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Adam Schiff Posing With Jeffrey Epstein?) There is also no evidence that COVID-19 was in circulation in the U.S. in August 2019, further undermining the claim. China first reported cases of the new virus to the World Health Organization in late December, months after Epstein’s death, according to Business Insider. The New York City medical examiner’s office conducted an autopsy shortly after Epstein’s death and concluded he hanged himself, according to The New York Times. While the autopsy results were later disputed by a pathologist hired by Epstein’s brother, there is no indication that Epstein died from COVID-19.

Fact Check:  Rwanda was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa to issue a lockdown in response to the global coronavirus pandemic, per the Washington Post. The country’s government started distributing food essentials to vulnerable populations on March 30, according to Rwandan media outlet Taarifa.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A photograph featuring what appears to be piles of neatly stacked bedding and food set out in a dusty area started circulating on Facebook and Twitter shortly thereafter. Social media users claimed the picture shows “Covid-19 relief materials in Rwanda to an (sic) household under president #Paul_Kagami.” (RELATED: Did Walmart Introduce A Staggered Shopping Schedule By Age Amid The Coronavirus Pandemic?) Former Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who was appointed to the African Union as a special envoy to mobilize international economic support for the continent’s fight against COVID-19, made a similar claim about the same photo in an April 8 tweet.  Responsible food distribution with social distancing to assist lower income households in the #COVID19 era! A great example from #Rwanda where community workers also distribute food and other necessities door-to-door @PaulKagame pic.twitter.com/EnukL4fTl3 — Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (@NOIweala) April 8, 2020  “Responsible food distribution with social distancing to assist lower income households in the #COVID19 era!” reads the tweet. “A great example from #Rwanda where community workers also distribute food and other necessities door-to-door @PaulKagame.”  The photo, however, dates back to at least May 2019, months before the new coronavirus first emerged in China. Several Facebook posts from May 2019 assert that a Gambian sheikh donated the supplies to Muslims in his region during the month of Ramadan, which occurred from May 5 to June 3 last year. The Daily Caller found a YouTube video, posted on May 21, 2019, that corroborates the claim of these Facebook posts. The French-speaking narrator attributes the piles of supplies to the same Gambia sheikh, and the piles of supplies in the video match those in the Facebook posts from May 2019.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “Thanks to those who have drawn my attention to the food distribution picture I tweeted earlier today.

The photo appears to be a screen grab of Obrador kissing the child’s cheek from a video of him greeting people. Fact Check: The former vice president has been criticized in the past for interacting with women and children in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. Multiple Facebook users have shared an image that they claim shows him holding a young girl and biting her on the cheek.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “If there were ever any doubt how mentally defunct Joe Biden is, a picture of him biting a child should dispel those doubts,” reads one such Facebook caption. “What a freak!” (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Joe Biden Looking At Dementia Books) The pictured man, however, is not Biden, but rather López Obrador, the president of Mexico. López Obrador’s verified Twitter account posted a video on March 14 that shows him walking through a crowd greeting people and, at one point, holding and kissing the young girl. The picture shared on Facebook appears to be a screen grab from that video. WATCH:   A la salida del hotel de Ometepec, saludé y atendí peticiones de la gente.

López Obrador can be seen kissing, hugging and touching numerous people in the three-minute video.  López Obrador has been criticized by some for not abiding by the social distancing guidelines put forward by his own government in an attempt to combat the spread of COVID-19. There have been more than 17,700 confirmed cases of the disease and some 1,730 deaths in Mexico as of press time, according to Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In the video, FBI agents can be seen loading boxes into a truck. The words “3000 series N95” are clearly visible printed on boxes at one point. Health care workers widely use N95 medical face masks to protect themselves from the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Multiple Facebook users have shared the video, claiming it depicts FBI agents seizing coronavirus-infected face masks sent from China. That is not what the video shows, however. The footage actually shows the FBI seizing medical equipment in late March from a New York City man who prosecutors say hoarded the supplies to sell above market value, according to AFP Fact Check. The equipment seized included approximately 192,000 N95 masks, 130,000 surgical masks, bottles of hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray, per the Department of Justice (DOJ) press release. The man also allegedly coughed in the direction of the FBI agents and told them he had coronavirus. In a statement to ABC News, the man’s attorney said the man “categorically denies” the allegations by the DOJ. (RELATED: Are Thieves Using Face Masks Doused In Chemicals To Rob People?)  Many of the medical-grade masks and gloves seized from the man will go to medical workers in New York and New Jersey, according to The New York Times. The need for personal protective equipment is acute in New York, as it has become an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S., with more than 304,000 confirmed cases in the state as of press time. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it would pay “fair market value” to the man, according to The New York Times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Trey Gowdy.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  There is no record of Gowdy writing the essay. He confirmed to the Daily Caller that he did not author it. Fact Check: The new coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, has sickened more than 3.2 million people and killed some 230,000 others worldwide as of press time, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Amid the ongoing pandemic, multiple Facebook users have attributed to Gowdy a conspiracy theory-laden essay about the coronavirus. The alleged essay starts: “I’m not saying Covid-19 isn’t real… But pay attention folks, there’s much more going on here than what meets the eye.” “It looks like Trump is a sure bet for reelection after fending off 3 years of investigations and impeachment, then all the sudden world crisis pandemic,” reads part of the essay attributed to Gowdy. “Stock market tumbles, companies are laying off employees, everything is closed and canceled, CEO’s of giant companies are resigning and indictments are coming.” Gowdy allegedly concluded the essay by noting that “it all just seems fishy, a little too well-timed if you ask me.” (Related: Did Gowdy Defend The Transgender Military Ban In An Interview With CNN?) The Caller didn’t find any credible media outlets crediting Gowdy with the essay, however. A version that’s unattributed to the former South Carolina congressman has been making the rounds on Facebook since at least mid-March.  Gowdy posted on his verified Facebook account on April 22 that he wanted “to alert folks there is a fraudulent post attributed to me circulating on social media.” In an email to the Caller, he also confirmed that he never said or wrote the coronavirus conspiracy theory. Gowdy has publicly discussed the new coronavirus before, including a recent appearance on Fox News to discuss proposed legislation that would allow U.S. citizens to sue China.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “There’s also a need, a responsibility for the world to hold China accountable,” he said. “Well, let me say, if you cannot warn other countries that a pandemic has been unleashed, you have no business being a leader on the world stage.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The claim appears to have originated on a satirical news website. Fact Check: Pelosi has been a popular target for viral misinformation and fabricated quotes on social media in recent weeks, with this particular Facebook post claiming the House speaker said, “Social Security recipients are just a burden on society.” (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Announce A 2-Month Suspension Of Social Security Starting In April?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is, however, no evidence Pelosi ever made the statement. A search of her social media accounts and congressional websites didn’t turn up any matches. Had she made such a comment, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it, except to debunk the remark. The quote appears to derive from a similar quote on Bustatroll.com, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” That website states in a fictional story that Pelosi made a very similar comment while “at a recent $5000-a-plate fundraising event for orphaned San Francisco lemurs.” Despite the disclaimer of the website’s satirical content, multiple Facebook users have continued to share the fake quote as if it was true.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/randy.l.shoemaker/posts/3348780601817763,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/28/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-delete-tweet-urging-people-visit-chinatown-san-francisco/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/22/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-fourth-husband-divorce/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/04/27/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-tweet-disgusted-donald-trump-keep-money/,https://www.facebook.com/randy.l.shoemaker/posts/3348780601817763,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/29/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-announce-suspension-social-security-april/,https://www.facebook.com/NancyPelosi/,https://www.facebook.com/pelosiforcongress/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Social%20Security%20recipients%20are%20just%20a%20burden%20on%20society%22%20(from%3ATeamPelosi%20OR%20from%3ASpeakerPelosi)&src=typed_query,https://www.instagram.com/speakerpelosi/,https://pelosi.house.gov/search/node/Social%20Security%20social%20OR%20security%20OR%20burdens%20OR%20society%20%22%20burdens%20on%20society%20%22,https://www.speaker.gov/search/node/Social%20Security%20social%20OR%20security%20OR%20burdens%20OR%20society%20%22%20burdens%20on%20society%20%22,https://www.google.com/search?ei=x6eOXqn2GNmlytMPhKaIsAk&q=%22Pelosi%22+%22Social+Security+recipients+are+nothing+more+than+burdens+on+society%22&oq=%22Pelosi%22+%22Social+Security+recipients+are+nothing+more+than+burdens+on+society%22&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA0oJCBcSBTEyLTYzSgkIGBIFMTItMThQ44kBWJHYAWCp2wFoB3AAeACAAY8BiAHbCJIBBDE3LjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjp9en8w9roAhXZknIEHQQTApYQ4dUDCAw&uact=5,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factheck-pelosi-social-security-recip/false-claim-nancy-pelosi-calls-social-security-recipients-leeches-or-burdens-on-society-idUSKCN21Y22L,https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/17/facebook-posts/nancy-pelosi-didnt-call-social-security-recipients/,https://bustatroll.org/2019/11/14/pelosi-social-security-recipients-are-just-a-burden-on-society/,https://bustatroll.org/about-us/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#770305120118053713161e1b0e14161b1b12055914181a","Did Nancy Pelosi Say, ‘Social Security Recipients Are Just A Burden On Society’?",,,,,

A spokesperson for the Biden campaign has confirmed they did not create the ad. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    As the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Biden has become a popular target for misinformation, particularly that which suggests he’s not mentally capable to serve as president. In late March, the Daily Caller debunked an edited video showing Biden perusing books about dementia, for instance. This particular Facebook post purportedly shows an ad released by the Biden campaign that states, “His Brain? No. His heart.” The ad, which has a burst of light emanating from Biden’s heart, also features a disclaimer: “Approved by Joe Biden. Paid for by Biden for President.” The ad appears to have been fabricated, despite it being shared widely on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit forums. The Caller didn’t find any credible media outlets reporting that the ad is genuine, and it doesn’t appear anywhere on Biden’s campaign website. There is also no record of it in the Facebook Ad Library. Photographer Salwan Georges took the original picture of Biden smiling for the Washington Post at the Iowa State Fair in August 2019. (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Joe Biden Looking At Dementia Books)  A spokesperson for the Biden campaign confirmed to The Associated Press that the ad is fake.

Fact Check: Whitmer sprung into the national spotlight after publicly criticizing the federal government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a move that incurred some criticism from President Donald Trump. And Trump is not the only one upset with the governor: Thousands of Michigan residents have taken to the streets to protest Whitmer’s executive order suspending non-essential activities.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Whitmer extended the statewide stay-at-home order April 24, while relaxing restrictions so some businesses can reopen and residents can participate in more activities. The stay-at-home order had previously required residents to remain indoors except for necessary outings and closed non-essential businesses and schools, according to Fox News. Michigan has been hit hard by the new coronavirus, with more than 40,000 confirmed cases as of April 29, according to data from the state. One Facebook post suggested Whitmer is prepared to use lethal force to enforce her stay-at-home order. It features two adjacent images: a screen grab of an article titled “Whitmer authorizes lethal force to maintain state lockdown” and an image of Whitmer with the caption “I don’t care if all the stats are fake I’m prepared to shoot people in the face if that’s what it takes to keep them safe.” There is no truth to the claim. The headline shown in the Facebook post originated on The People’s Cube, a political satire website. The article lists the author as “Chedoh, Kommissar of Viral Infections, Hero of Change, Prophet of the Future Truth.” However, the Facebook post makes no note of the story and headline’s satirical nature, presenting it as genuine news. (RELATED: Did Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf Mandate Closures For Schools And Workplaces?) “This is completely false information,” Chelsea Lewis, deputy press secretary for Whitmer’s office, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email. “Posts like these are being spread across social media platforms to create rumors and fear. The governor’s main priority remains protecting public health and the people of Michigan.”  The text of Whitmer’s stay-at-home order stated that a “willful violation of this order is a misdemeanor,” in accordance with MCL 10.33 and MCL 30.405(3).

That applies to both mosques and churches equally. Fact Check: In response to the coronavirus pandemic, many states have taken measures to curb the spread of the virus, including closing non-essential businesses and banning large gatherings.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz extended in early April the state’s stay-at-home order through at least May 3. Under that executive order, Minnesotans must continue to stay home except for essential needs, and many non-essential businesses remain closed, according to MPR News. A viral Facebook post alleges that the stay-at-home order shuts down churches but allows mosques to remain open, saying, “Just want to inform you all that all Christian churches in Minnesota are closed!!! BUT the governor has allowed the mosque to remain open!! We should all be outraged by this!” (RELATED: Has Poland Refused To Allow The Building Of Mosques?) The stay-at-home order does exempt “officials, workers, and leaders in houses of worship” to perform their duties “wherever their services may be needed.”  That includes staff necessary “to plan, record, and distribute online or broadcast content to community members,” according to the executive order. However, in-person gatherings of congregants are still not permitted regardless of religion, as they do not appear in the list of exempted activities and business sectors. People may attend funerals at houses of worship, provided the gathering consists of fewer than 10 attendees, according to the stay-at-home order.  A spokesperson for the Minnesota state government confirmed to Reuters that there is “absolutely no distinction between churches and mosques in any order issued by the Governor.” As of April 29, Minnesota has more than 4,600 confirmed cases of coronavirus and over 300 deaths, according to Minnesota’s Department of Health.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The original video, taken in November 2017, can be found in The Associated Press archives. It shows Israeli police spraying “a crowd of protesters blocking Jerusalem traffic with a powerful burst of ‘skunk’ spray – water treated with a foul-smelling chemical used to disperse protests on Sunday,” according to its caption. The Times of Israel wrote about the event when it happened and described the protesters as “ultra-Orthodox Jews” protesting “the jailing of young seminary students for draft-dodging” by blocking traffic. In Israel, all adults must complete compulsory military service once they turn 18. Large gatherings have been temporarily banned in New York City to help limit the spread of coronavirus. On Tuesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio sent the police to break up a crowd of more than 2,500 Orthodox Jews who had gathered in Brooklyn to attend the funeral of Rabbi Chaim Mertz, according to NBC News. Orthodox Jewish leaders have said that their communities are discouraging group gatherings, The Associated Press reported.  The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to suggest the video was filmed in New York, however. We rate this claim false.

The World Health Organization also addresses the claim on its myth busters page, saying, “To date, there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.” For a mosquito to transmit a pathogen from one host to another, it must suck blood from an infected host and become infected itself in the salivary glands. The pathogen must “be highly specialized to survive within both a host animal or human and within the mosquito” to transmit via the saliva that the mosquito injects when it bites, Montana State University entomology professor Dr. Robert Peterson explained in an email to the Daily Caller. “There is no scientific evidence that the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has this ability,” Peterson added.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Professor Charles Lieber was arrested for making false statements to federal authorities and concealing his connections to China, not for creating the coronavirus. The new coronavirus is not man-made or a biological weapon. Fact Check: The post includes the Boston ABC affiliate WCVB’s news report about Leiber’s arrest in late January. The video caption claims the former chair of Harvard University’s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, got arrested because he “manufactured and sold” the new coronavirus to China. The FBI arrested Lieber on Jan. 28 on charges of making false statements to federal authorities about his affiliation with the Wuhan University of Technology and his participation in China’s Thousand Talents Plan, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). The Thousand Talents Plan aims to attract Chinese ex-pats and foreign scientists to China.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is, however, no link between Lieber’s arrest and the new coronavirus that first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. He was not arrested for creating and selling the virus to China, and a DOJ spokesperson told FactCheck.org the agency had “made no such allegation.” The DOJ also announced that two non-Harvard Chinese researchers had been charged in unrelated cases on the same day: Yanqing Yi, who was charged “with one count each of visa fraud, making false statements, acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy,” and Zaosong Zheng, who was charged with “one count of smuggling goods from the United States and one count of making false, fictitious or fraudulent statements,” according to a DOJ press release. Their arrests were also unrelated to the new coronavirus. The exact origin of the new coronavirus remains unknown, but experts believe it likely came from bats, CNN reported. Its genetic sequence shares similarities with the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which spread from bats to civet cats to humans, according to Nature.

The claim may have stemmed from a remark he made at an April 13 press briefing. Fact Check: The viral post alleges Trump said that he was “getting calls from hundreds of governors,” despite there being only 50 U.S. governors.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Searching his Twitter accounts – @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS – and ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets, the Daily Caller didn’t find any record of the president making the remark. The statement also appears nowhere in Factbase, an online database that collects Trump’s interviews, speeches and tweets. The claim may have stemmed from Trump’s remarks at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on April 13, after he showed a video that included clips of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, among others, praising his administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump then said at the briefing that he could “give you hundreds of clips like that from governors,” according to the transcript. (Did The NBA Tell Trump To ‘Resign Or We’ll Never Play Again’?) “We have hundreds of statements,” he went on to say. “Hundreds of statements, including from Democrats and Democrat governors.”  During a phone interview on “Fox and Friends” several weeks earlier, Trump said, “I get on calls, and I get on a lot of the governor calls where we’ll have all 50 governors plus where we have some territories also, but we have 50 governors, and I’ll tell you what if you could listen to those calls, you’d never hear a complaint.” Other fact-checkers have also looked into the claim and found no evidence that Trump ever said he was “getting calls from hundreds of governors.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The DHS cannot mobilize the National Guard in this manner. Fact Check: The viral post urges Americans to stockpile necessities before the National Guard, purportedly mobilized by the DHS, begins to enforce a nationwide 14-day quarantine in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Similar claims have also circulated in the form of text messages in recent weeks.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The White House National Security Council debunked similar text message rumors of a national quarantine in mid-March.  Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID19. #coronavirus — NSC (@WHNSC) March 16, 2020  “Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE,” reads the tweet. “There is no national lockdown. @CDCgov has and will continue to post the latest guidance on #COVID-19. #coronavirus.” The Ascension and Iberia Parish Offices of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness in Louisiana also debunked the image, noting that DHS cannot mobilize the National Guard in this manner. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Train Car With COVID-19 Marking)  “The Department of Homeland Security does not have authority to mobilize the National Guard as described in the graphic,” Maj. Rob Perino, spokesman for the National Guard Bureau, confirmed to the Daily Caller in an email. “Additionally, there is no discussion of a nation-wide quarantine.” National Guard members across the country have been activated to support states’ responses to the new coronavirus – but that doesn’t include a national quarantine of any kind. They are “supporting community based testing sites, creating additional medical capacity, and providing logistical support to include transportation and distribution of medical supplies and food,” according to Perino.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The post also misinterprets the Stafford Act, which President Donald Trump invoked when he declared a national emergency on March 13. That federal disaster relief law actually empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist state and local governments in dealing with the outbreak and to coordinate the country’s response. On April 16, Trump announced guidelines laying out a “phased and deliberate approach” to restoring normal activity in areas that have strong testing and are seeing a decrease in coronavirus cases, according to The Associated Press.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence The New York Times used the 2013 photo in any story about the coronavirus pandemic. The coronavirus story shown utilizing the outdated image comes from the website Kanyi Daily. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Multiple Facebook users have claimed The New York Times is using an image of coffins from a 2013 shipwreck in its coverage of the coronavirus pandemic’s death toll in Italy, where more than 27,300 people have died as of press time. This particular Facebook post shows two screen grabs: one of a 2013 New York Times article titled “Europe Pledges Aid to Italy for Refugees” and one of another article titled “Italy Records Highest Death Rate Of Coronavirus Disease As 627 Persons Dies In A Single Day.” Both articles feature the same photo of coffins lined up with what appears to be a warehouse. “Ever feel like were being lied to?” reads the post. “The New York Times published this same exact photo again seven ye … ” The headline in the article on the left contains a grammatical error, making it immediately suspect. (RELATED: Was Tulsi Gabbard ‘Labeled’ A ‘Right-Wing Extremist’ By The New York Times?)  The Daily Caller News Foundation searched The New York Times’ website for the article on the left and found no matches. There is no indication that Tobias Sylvester, the author of the story, works for the newspaper. Nor does The New York Times appear to have used the photo in any of its coronavirus coverage, according to Google and Tineye reverse image searches. The article about coronavirus deaths in Italy appears to come from the news website Kanyi Daily, which published the story in March. The picture of the coffins is no longer the featured image of the story.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The photo, taken in 2013, shows the tragic aftermath of a shipwreck that killed hundreds of refugees attempting to enter Italy via boat, according to its caption. In recent months, some social media users have shared images from the 2013 shipwreck in posts about coronavirus, giving the false impression that the coffins contain coronavirus victims.

The U.K. Department of Health and Social Care debunked the claim on Twitter, and so did Granato.

Obama has been publicly supportive of vaccines in the past. Fact Check: The viral post suggests that Obama called for Africans to not accept vaccines from the United States and Europe because they are part of a “Machiavellian plan.” Here’s the full quote attributed to Obama:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    I’ll be an accomplice if I don’t denounce this evil act white people want to do to Africans, first of all I was born in America but I’m African blood, I’m not going to allow white people to kill Africans with their toxic vaccines, I ask Africans to be smart, and to ensure that coronavirus vaccines do not enter African territories, there is a Machiavellian plan they invent, saying we come to help Africans, or that they will come to kill you, I will let this message be shared everywhere, to awaken African minds so that the vaccines do not arrive in Africa. There is, however, no evidence that Obama ever made this statement. No news reporting could be found to corroborate the alleged quote. The Daily Caller News Foundation also searched Obama’s Twitter account and ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets, but didn’t turn up any matches. The message contradicts Obama’s record on vaccines. In February 2015, he publicly encouraged parents to vaccinate their children, for instance. (RELATED: Did Ilhan Omar Say That ‘All White Men Should Be Put In Chains’?) Katie Hill, his spokeswoman, confirmed to The Associated Press that Obama didn’t say the alleged quote and is pro-vaccination. The quote stemmed from a recent controversy in which two French doctors suggested during a television segment that a tuberculosis vaccine be tested in Africa as a potential treatment for coronavirus, according to The Associated Press. The fake Obama quote started circulating around the same time the controversy received significant social media attention in early April.

Fact Check: The H1N1 influenza virus, which killed between 151,700 and 575,400 people worldwide, was first detected in the U.S. in April 2009, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Then-President Barack Obama declared a public health emergency the same month.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral Facebook post claims that Trump criticized the Obama administration’s handling of the pandemic, allegedly tweeting, “Obama’s handling of this whole pandemic has been terrible! As President, ALL responsibility becomes yours during a crisis like this, whether or not you’re entirely to blame. John McCain, and for that matter myself, would never let thousands of Americans die from a pandemic while in office.” The claim comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that has so far killed over 58,000 people in the U.S., according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. The alleged tweet is a fake, however. A search of Trump’s verified Twitter accounts – @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS – turned up no matches. Nor did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the comment in the Trump Twitter Archive, a database of Trump’s tweets dating back to May 2009. The 289 characters in the alleged tweeted far exceed the 140-character limit Twitter had until 2017, further adding to the post’s dubiousness.

Verdict: False There is no evidence that neem leaves can prevent COVID-19 infection. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The internet has become replete with alleged preventatives for COVID-19 since the new coronavirus that causes the disease first emerged in China in late 2019. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Marijuana ‘Kills’ The Coronavirus) This particular Facebook post claims burning neem leaves can prevent people from contracting COVID-19. Neem leaves come from a type of  tree native to India and Southeast Asia and are valued by some for their medicinal properties. The Daily Caller didn’t find any scientific studies that found neem leaves can prevent COVID-19 infection, however. Neither the World Health Organization (WHO) nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the practice on their respective websites. Malaysia’s Ministry of Health also published an infographic warning that neem leaves can cause serious negative health effects when used as a treatment for COVID-19. Fact-checkers have debunked claims that other neem leaf preparations can treat coronavirus. The WHO notes on its website that there is currently no evidence that traditional or home remedies can prevent infection.  As of press time, the new coronavirus has sickened more than 3 million people and killed some 216,000 others worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

No media reports corroborate the post’s claim. Fact Check: Many states, including Ohio, have issued stay-at-home orders to help curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine laid out on Monday a plan to gradually reopen the state starting May 1, when the stay-at-home order is set to expire.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Multiple Facebook users recently shared a photo of what appears to be a tank with the words “Toledo Police” painted on the side, with one user claiming, “They’re Not Playing About This Stay At Home Order They’re About To Start Rounding People Up Be Safe People.” The Toledo Police Department issued a statement on Facebook addressing the photo shortly after it started circulating widely online. (RELATED: No, Trains Moving Military Equipment Do Not Mean Martial Law Is Coming)  “Citizens: Toledo Police do NOT own a tank,” the post reads. “The department had one previously but it was returned in February of 2016….more than four years ago.

Her deputy chief of staff has said that her office never tweeted the video. Fact Check:  The video shows a clip from the San Francisco Bay Area CBS affiliate KPIX’s report about Pelosi visiting Chinatown on Feb. 24. In the video, Pelosi says, “You should come to Chinatown. Precautions have been taken by our city. We know that there is concern about tourism, traveling throughout the world, but we think it’s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though there were 21 active cases of coronavirus in California at the time, none were in San Francisco, KPIX reported. Her visit came three weeks before six Bay Area counties instituted shelter-in-place policies, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. A viral Facebook post alleged in a headline that Pelosi deleted a Feb. 24 tweet containing that video, despite no evidence that she did so. (RELATED: Does Nancy Pelosi’s Daughter Sit On The Board Of The Kennedy Center?) The Daily Caller searched for news reports corroborating the claim but only turned up articles from other fact-checkers debunking it. ProPublica’s archive of deleted tweets from elected officials also has no record of Pelosi deleting the alleged video from her verified House Twitter account. While ProPublica’s archive did not track her campaign Twitter account at the time, there is no evidence she deleted it from there either. Had the House speaker done so, there would likely be screen grabs of it, yet none could be found online.  “Somehow we didn’t add her when we took over the app in 2016 from Sunlight, but we’re tracking that account now,” Derek Willis, a news developer at ProPublica, explained to the Caller in an email. Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s Deputy Chief of Staff, denied that her office had ever posted the video.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   Fact check: We never posted this video. It’s obviously local TV coverage of the Speaker visiting Chinatown in San Francisco three weeks prior to the shelter-in-place order. https://t.co/sVCqbkD0DF — Drew Hammill (@Drew_Hammill) April 16, 2020  “Fact check: We never posted this video. It’s obviously local TV coverage of the Speaker visiting Chinatown in San Francisco three weeks prior to the shelter-in-place order,” Hammill tweeted. The claim appears to stem from a tweet from President Donald Trump that accused the House speaker of deleting the same video.  Crazy Nancy Pelosi deleted this from her Twitter account.

Fact Check: Johnson tweeted on March 27 that he had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. He spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care, before being released on April 12, according to NPR. A viral Facebook post claims that the British prime minister did not have COVID-19, citing two doctors who allegedly treated him in the hospital as sources. (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Mass Grave For Coronavirus Victims In Italy)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Dr. Shirley Knott allegedly said Johnson “had the most pathetic, contrived cough I have heard in all my years of practise,” while Dr. Ashleigh Pullin was quoted as saying, “If he had Covid-19 then I’m not a doctor!” The post asserted that these statements are “proof” that the public had been “hoodwinked.” But there is no evidence this story is real. Neither doctor mentioned in the post can be found on the General Medical Council’s register, a database that lists all the doctors in the United Kingdom. Nor could any news reporting could be found to back up the claim. Reuters Fact Check traced the origins of the post to Facebook user Anthony George, who originally shared the story on the satirical Facebook page “A Poke in the Eye With a Sharp Wit.” The page describes itself as a “place for political humour and satire, poking fun at those in the government of the day.” George confirmed to Reuters that the post was written as satire, saying, “There was nothing personal intended towards Boris Johnson himself indeed, had it been Jeremy Corbyn or any other PM, I would have said the same.”  However, many of those who shared George’s post failed to realize or disclaim its satirical nature.

The article originated on a satirical news website. Fact Check: The website Dachshund Daily published an article on March 8 that claims the “Six Million Dollar Man” actor, who purportedly died during a surgical procedure, left $6 million to Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign in his will. Multiple Facebook users subsequently shared the article.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Majors left 66% of his sizeable $9 million bequest to Trump 2020 – a representative aggregate of $6 million,” states the article. “A portion from his will indicated his adoration for our President.” The article also quotes an alleged section of the actor’s will. (RELATED: Have Jennifer Aniston And Other Stars Decided To Start A ‘Celebrities For Trump’ Company?) “President Trump has demonstrated the administration and quality that this nation has needed for quite a long time,” reads the supposed clause. “My commitment will go to him yet will truly be for America. The sum is bionic. I trust it gives the USA power. I know Steve Austin would affirm.” Majors has not died, however. His wife recently posted a series of photos on Instagram to wish Majors a happy birthday on April 23, saying, “HAPPY BIRTHDAY SWEETHEART!! You are loved, adored, cherished, appreciated and celebrated today and everyday!”  The Daily Caller didn’t find any Federal Election Commission records showing that Majors has donated to Trump in the past. He and his wife attended a Christmas party at the White House in 2018, according to The Associated Press. The claim appears to have originated on Conservative Tears, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” The article, which put up the headline “‘Bionic Man’ Lee Majors Dead At 83;$6 Million Left To Trump 2020,” is satirical in nature and should not be treated as fact.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jkashfkjahsfjkash4424/posts/489436671963041,https://www.dachshunddaily.com/bionic-man-lee-majors-dead-at-836-million-left-to-trump-2020/?fbclid=IwAR1raUmWAhew521svkKHi_NXWzlGWOyFLqDeyg-DS0Cfnq7lJRQuXJ3XW10,https://www.amazon.com/Six-Million-Dollar-Man-Complete/dp/B0126M389E/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2H2595DWM9WUO&dchild=1&keywords=the+six+million+dollar+man&qid=1586996532&s=movies-tv&sprefix=the+six+mill%2Cmovies-tv%2C317&sr=1-1,https://www.facebook.com/jkashfkjahsfjkash4424/posts/489436671963041,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/02/07/fact-check-jennifer-aniston-celebrities-trump-company/,https://www.instagram.com/p/B_U2QvapKbp/?hl=en,https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Lee%20Majors,https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Harvey%20Lee%20Yeary,https://apnews.com/2b9b03378a7c4d17ab38ea8398845278,https://conservativetears.com/2019/12/22/bionic-contribution/,https://conservativetears.com/about/,https://conservativetears.com/2019/12/22/bionic-contribution/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9ce8eef9eaf3eedcf8fdf5f0e5fffdf0f0f9eeb2fff3f1",Did Actor Lee Majors Die And Leave The Trump Campaign $6 Million In His Will?,,,,,

Fact Check: Facebook posts containing alleged footage from Kim Jong Un’s funeral have circulated amid media reports speculating that the North Korean leader is dead or near death. The rumors started circulating after Kim Jong Un missed the April 15 commemoration of the 108th birthday of his grandfather and founder of the country’s dynastic regime, Kim Il Sung.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular Facebook video, which premiered as a live stream on April 27, shows a repeating video of people paying their respects to a person lying in a clear glass coffin. The caption claims, “EXCLUSIVE: Kim Jong Un funeral scenes.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims North Korea ‘Accidentally Nuked’ One Of Its Cities In 2017) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the video clips actually come from his father and predecessor Kim Jong Il‘s funeral in December 2011. All of the clips appear in The Associated Press’ archived footage of that event. Kim Jong Un attended the event and can be seen in the original footage, though those clips were not included in the Facebook live stream. South Korea has poured water on speculation that Kim Jung Un is seriously ill or dead. Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees engagement with North Korea, said on Tuesday that Kim Jong Un may have decided against attending the April 15 commemoration out of fear of catching the coronavirus, Reuters reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/kimyojongNK/videos/597258260870926/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAJ9RyDyqBUPmgrT2VXb8TTUXtAEaYBarUT3UjfG2x_tFTlW2xS51zgeowsnbh2juibz53ADEuIJaTi6aPBOARSvPC5WCfdIwYoIdA8l-3tFm4UDS0INuq1Esx2vmbfNkvx2JFaj_whXcZEMO5qOp4GAItkqjJWbgW1gy0PXevSj1L944jvUmrNM0upSUL-aANhTQkhF_LqDLkjirX72wlVVS6UgSvq1_WpEWSLvPCMTVM1jDHMJrBDo4p6ODfXT5_zQq3gFzj6bqJBiPiNsvCu4u91hSMpmeuvosI7r-o-ocQ-mqcIZ56jIKafmb12p2olyye0hS3xNSk&__tn__=H-R,https://www.facebook.com/kimyojongNK/videos/597258260870926/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAJ9RyDyqBUPmgrT2VXb8TTUXtAEaYBarUT3UjfG2x_tFTlW2xS51zgeowsnbh2juibz53ADEuIJaTi6aPBOARSvPC5WCfdIwYoIdA8l-3tFm4UDS0INuq1Esx2vmbfNkvx2JFaj_whXcZEMO5qOp4GAItkqjJWbgW1gy0PXevSj1L944jvUmrNM0upSUL-aANhTQkhF_LqDLkjirX72wlVVS6UgSvq1_WpEWSLvPCMTVM1jDHMJrBDo4p6ODfXT5_zQq3gFzj6bqJBiPiNsvCu4u91hSMpmeuvosI7r-o-ocQ-mqcIZ56jIKafmb12p2olyye0hS3xNSk&__tn__=H-R,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/20/politics/kim-jong-un-north-korea/index.html,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kim-jong-un-in-vegetative-state-japanese-media-report-says-2020-04-25,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kim-Il-Sung,https://www.facebook.com/kimyojongNK/videos/597258260870926/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAJ9RyDyqBUPmgrT2VXb8TTUXtAEaYBarUT3UjfG2x_tFTlW2xS51zgeowsnbh2juibz53ADEuIJaTi6aPBOARSvPC5WCfdIwYoIdA8l-3tFm4UDS0INuq1Esx2vmbfNkvx2JFaj_whXcZEMO5qOp4GAItkqjJWbgW1gy0PXevSj1L944jvUmrNM0upSUL-aANhTQkhF_LqDLkjirX72wlVVS6UgSvq1_WpEWSLvPCMTVM1jDHMJrBDo4p6ODfXT5_zQq3gFzj6bqJBiPiNsvCu4u91hSMpmeuvosI7r-o-ocQ-mqcIZ56jIKafmb12p2olyye0hS3xNSk&__tn__=H-R,https://www.facebook.com/kimyojongNK/videos/597258260870926/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAJ9RyDyqBUPmgrT2VXb8TTUXtAEaYBarUT3UjfG2x_tFTlW2xS51zgeowsnbh2juibz53ADEuIJaTi6aPBOARSvPC5WCfdIwYoIdA8l-3tFm4UDS0INuq1Esx2vmbfNkvx2JFaj_whXcZEMO5qOp4GAItkqjJWbgW1gy0PXevSj1L944jvUmrNM0upSUL-aANhTQkhF_LqDLkjirX72wlVVS6UgSvq1_WpEWSLvPCMTVM1jDHMJrBDo4p6ODfXT5_zQq3gFzj6bqJBiPiNsvCu4u91hSMpmeuvosI7r-o-ocQ-mqcIZ56jIKafmb12p2olyye0hS3xNSk&__tn__=H-R,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/02/24/fact-check-north-korea-accidentally-nuked-cities-missile/,https://www.biography.com/dictator/kim-jong-il,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCBhMIK_KGM,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/26/asia/kim-jong-un-north-korea-health-intl/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-kim/south-korea-says-north-koreas-kim-may-be-trying-to-avoid-coronavirus-idUSKCN22A0NZ,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d3a7a1b6a5bca193b7b2babfaab0b2bfbfb6a1fdb0bcbe",Viral Video Claims To Show Kim Jong Un’s Funeral,,,,,

And so until you’re widely vaccinated, those may not come back at all.” Angel claims the clip shows Gates “advocating for church gatherings to never return,” despite the Microsoft co-founder never mentioning churches in the entire interview. (RELATED: Did Bill Gates Write This Statement About The ‘Spiritual Purpose’ Of Coronavirus?) Gates simply speculated that certain large gatherings may not be permitted by the government until a COVID-19 vaccine becomes widely available. He also discussed the need to prioritize testing and the possible timeline for when a vaccine could be ready, among other things, according to the full video. There is no indication from the CBS interview that he is in favor of church gatherings never returning, and The Daily Caller News Foundation found no media reports to corroborate the claim that he has advocated for anything to that effect.  Gates has made supportive statements about religion in the past. “The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important,” he said in a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone. “We’ve raised our kids in a religious way; they’ve gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: The internet has become replete with misinformation related to Italy’s outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. This particular post, along with the accompanying video, purports to show the bodies of deceased Italian coronavirus patients being dumped into a mass grave. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Coffins Of Italian Coronavirus Patients?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The footage, which first appeared on TikTok and later circulated widely on Facebook, actually comes from the 2007 miniseries “Pandemic.” That miniseries follows a fictional doctor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as she “races to find a vaccine” for a deadly virus infecting Los Angeles residents, according to IMDb. Here’s the original “Pandemic” clip:  Someone appears to have layered music over the footage, presumably to drown out the original audio and obscure its source. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Coffins Of Italian Coronavirus Patients?)  While the miniseries does revolve around the outbreak of a deadly virus, it has nothing to do with the ongoing pandemic.  The new coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and has since spread to over 180 countries and regions, including Italy. Italy has become one of the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 199,000 confirmed cases and nearly 27,000 deaths at the time of publication, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered the image is actually a promotional still from the medical drama series “Grey’s Anatomy.” Two versions of the still appear on Getty Images, with the captions both saying they come from “Wishin’ and Hopin,'” the 14th episode of the television drama’s third season. That episode, which first aired in February 2007, features a plot line where a patient’s toxic blood causes several of the main characters to collapse during surgery. The still shows that scene – not Italian doctors who have died from coronavirus, as the post falsely suggests. The new coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.

There is no evidence the fire was deliberately set or intended to target Chinese-owned businesses, according to local news reporting. Fact Check: The footage shows a building engulfed in flames and people running from it, while a woman in a nearby building shouts for them to “get out.” The caption claims it depicts “Nigerians burning down Chinese businesses in retaliation for attacks on Africans in China.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook caption’s claim is inaccurate, however. Local media outlets that picked up the video reported the fire occurred at the Dugbe Market in Ibadan, Nigeria, on April 15. Witnesses said it started accidentally and “emanated from an electrical spark that started from welding equipment,” according to The Guardian Nigeria. While multiple shops, residential buildings and vehicles sustained damage from the blaze, there was no mention of any Chinese-owned businesses being affected or targeted. The post appears to reference recent reports that African citizens have faced discrimination under coronavirus mitigation efforts in the Chinese city of Guangzhou. African citizens have reported being evicted from their apartments, being tested for coronavirus multiple times without receiving results and being discriminated against in public, according to Reuters. China has denied such allegations from U.S. and African officials, according to NBC News.

That figure has since increased to roughly 209,800 at the time of publication. Fact Check: The coronavirus pandemic has spread to over 180 countries and regions, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. In response to the global pandemic, numerous countries have closed borders, instituted national lockdowns and banned mass gatherings, according to Business Insider.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral Facebook post falsely alleges that, as of April 9, more than 1.6 million people had died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The post reads, “COVID-19 has killed 1,634,373 people in whole WORLD and you are alive,,, (sic) just use 2sec to thank GOD.” But that number is inaccurate. Roughly 92,800 people around the world had died from coronavirus as of April 9, according to the World Health Organization’s (WHO) situation report. The WHO also reported approximately 1.5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 around the world for the same day. Worldometers, which collects data from countries’ public health agencies, reported slightly higher global numbers: some 98,800 deaths and some 1.6 million confirmed cases. There are, however, concerns that some countries are underreporting COVID-19 deaths. The New York Times reported that the Central Intelligence Agency believes that China has underreported COVID-19 deaths. The death toll in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the new coronavirus first emerged, is likely much higher than its current figure, according to The Washington Post.  Other countries, including Spain, Ecuador and France, have reported that significantly more people have died overall than in previous years, indicating they may also be underreporting coronavirus deaths, according to The New York Times.

The tweet has been fabricated. Fact Check: The image, which has been shared more than 121,000 times, shows a screen grab of an alleged tweet from Pelosi from December 2017, presumably referencing the tax reform bill President Donald Trump signed into law earlier that month. The alleged tweet was later deleted, according to text below the screen-grabbed tweet. “I’m disgusted with ‘President’ Trump allowing people to keep more of the money they earn,” Pelosi purportedly tweeted. “It is this type of widespread theft of public resources that keeps America from being great ‘Mr. President.'”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But there is no record of Pelosi tweeting the statement. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched Pelosi’s verified Twitter account and ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets, but didn’t find anything resembling the statement attributed to her in the Facebook post. An internet search also failed to turn up any evidence suggesting that the tweet is real. Social media users often fabricate tweets from politicians using websites like TweetGen and the now-defunct Tweeterino. This particular fake tweet has circulated online since 2017 and has been previously debunked by fact-checkers. (RELATED: Did Chuck Schumer Delete A Tweet Saying Trump’s Travel Ban Is ‘An Excuse To Further His Ongoing War Against Immigrants’?)

The misuse of such laxative products can cause serious negative health effects. Fact Check: The internet has become replete with social media posts about alleged preventatives and cures for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. This particular post claims consuming magnesium citrate can “kill” the new virus and stop it from spreading. (RELATED: Does Sunlight Kill Coronavirus?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “As a medical professional I want to help as many people as possible in these hard times.

DRINK A FULL BOTTLE PRIOR TO LEAVING !!! It will give you a few hours of a barrier.” Magnesium citrate is a laxative used to treat constipation on a short-term basis and to empty the bowels before colonoscopies. The misuse of such laxative products can cause dehydration, electrolyte imbalances and bleeding, among other dangerous health effects, according to Brown University. There is no scientific evidence that using magnesium citrate and other laxatives can prevent or cure the new coronavirus. Neither the World Health Organization (WHO) nor the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend magnesium citrate for such use on their respective websites. Experts have also warned the public that taking supplements and home remedies that have not been approved for preventing or treating COVID-19 by the Food and Drug Administration can cause serious negative health effects, according to The New York Times. The CDC recommends thorough hand washing, social distancing and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, among other preventative measures, to reduce the risk of infection.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

There do not appear to be any clinical trials for potential vaccines against the new virus underway in the country at this time. Fact Check: At the time of publication, Senegal has reported more than 730 cases of coronavirus and 9 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. (RELATED: Do Blood Donors Automatically Get Tested For Coronavirus?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral Facebook post falsely alleges that seven Senegalese children died on April 8 after receiving vaccinations against the new coronavirus, despite a spokeswoman for Senegal’s health ministry confirming to AFP Fact Check that the claim was “fake news.” No clinical trials for coronavirus vaccines appear to be currently underway in Senegal or any other African country, according to the scientific journal Nature. The claim stems from a video with doctored audio about a man being arrested in the capital city of Dakar for administering vaccines that started circulating online in late March. Witnesses told state-owned news outlet France 24 that while the man was posing as an official from the health ministry and warning people about the virus, he was actually just selling cosmetics, according to Reuters. No children received vaccines or died during the incident. Drugmakers are racing to develop effective treatments and vaccines for the new coronavirus, with some having already moved to human trials, according to CBS News.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jason.yates.77715/posts/2816533881727550,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/19/fact-check-blood-donation-tested-coronavirus-automatically/,https://www.facebook.com/jason.yates.77715/posts/2816533881727550,https://factcheck.afp.com/senegalese-children-did-not-die-coronavirus-vaccine-which-does-not-yet-exist,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00073-5,https://perma.cc/E2HW-H25B,https://observers.france24.com/fr/20200408-test-vaccin-covid-19-enfants-senegal-video-coronavirus,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-children-senegal-vaccine-co/false-claim-seven-children-killed-in-senegal-after-receiving-covid-19-vaccine-idUSKBN21Y2SI,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19-human-clinical-trial-oxford-england/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#22565047544d506246434b4e5b41434e4e47500c414d4f",Did 7 Children Die After Being Vaccinated For Coronavirus In Senegal?,,,,,

(RELATED: Viral Image Claims Coronavirus Cannot Spread In Areas With Warm Climates)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Among other places where people typically gather, churches have been temporarily closed in Jerusalem due to lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus. The image shows a screen grab of writer David Videcette‘s tweet showing a video of the moment when the Church of the Holy Sepulchre allegedly closed its doors for the first time since 1349. “This is the moment The Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was closed due to coronavirus,” part of the tweet reads. “Last time this happened was in 1349, during The Black Death, a bubonic plague epidemic.” On March 25, the church closed its doors indefinitely to comply with coronavirus lockdown measures in the city of Jerusalem. That closure does not mark the first time its doors have been shut to the public since 1349, however. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre has actually closed on several occasions since 1349. Most recently, the church closed for three days over a tax dispute between church leaders and Israeli officials in 2018, according to Agence France-Press.  Videcette later amended his statement in a subsequent tweet.  That’s not to say it’s never been closed. It was shut a number of times for very short periods in disputes or protests in 1990, 1999 & 2005.

The fictional story originated on the satire website Bustatroll.org. Fact Check: The website Maga2020 News published the article on March 16 claiming the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Trump could remove Schumer from the Senate. (RELATED: Did LeBron James Tell The NBA, ‘Dump The Anthem, Or I’ll Quit’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “The Supreme Court remains an independent judicial body, outside the influence of government at any level,” the story quoted an alleged legal clause as saying. “Should any government official take it upon himself to attempt to influence, coerce, intimidate, or threaten a Supreme Court Justice in order to sway decisions, that official shall be subject to discretionary removal at the hands of the sitting President of these United States.” The article references Schumer saying Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh “won’t know what hit” them if they voted to uphold abortion restrictions in a case the Supreme Court was hearing in early March. Schumer later said those remarks were not meant as a threat of bodily harm against the justices, but rather a warning to Republicans about the political backlash they could face, according to The New York Times. The Maga2020 News story is completely fabricated. It lifts nearly word-for-word from Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” Yet, while Bustatroll.org disclaims the satirical nature of its content, Maga2020 News failed to make that distinction when republishing the article, leading some readers to believe it was a genuine news story. The supposed “Article 6, Section C3-P0” does not exist, and no news reporting could be found about any alleged Supreme Court ruling allowing Trump to remove Schumer from office.

Fact Check: The internet is replete with supposed COVID-19 cures, many of which have been thoroughly debunked. One post recently shared on Facebook claims that drinking tonic water with the mineral zinc will “kill” the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Quinine found in Tonic water along with 50-100mg of zinc daily will kill COVID-19,” reads the post. “Hydroxychloroquine is the synthetic version of Quinine. Drink some fresh squeezed lemon juice with your Tonic water. You’ll be GOLDEN!” Hydroxychloroquine is an anti-malaria drug that is currently undergoing clinical trials to test its safety and efficacy in treating COVID-19. Quinine, a synthetic relative of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, is also used to treat malaria, according to The Associated Press. Tonic water contains “no more than 83 mg of quinine per liter – a much lower concentration than the 500 to 1,000 mg in the therapeutic dose of quinine tablets,” according to Harvard University. (RELATED: Did A Man Die ‘After Taking Malaria Medication Touted By Trump As Possible Cure For Coronavirus’?) There is no scientific evidence that consuming tonic water and zinc can kill the new coronavirus, however. Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the World Health Organization (WHO) mention the tonic water and zinc mixture on their respective websites, and numerous fact-checkers have debunked the claim. The WHO notes that while some home remedies may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, there is no evidence they can prevent or cure the disease.  Fever-Tree, a beverage company that makes tonic water, also debunked the notion that tonic water can combat COVID-19 on its website after receiving multiple inquiries, saying, “Anti-malaria drugs contain a significantly higher amount of quinine than tonic water so we would not advise using our tonic water for anything other than making a delicious drink to keep your spirits up during this difficult time.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

His publicist confirmed to the Daily Caller that the claim is false, and his widow has also disputed it on Instagram. Fact Check: Diffie, the country singer known for hits such as “Home” and “Pickup Man,” died from COVID-19 complications on March 29, according to The Associated Press. He was 61.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Two days prior, Diffie had posted a statement on his verified Facebook page, saying, “I am under the care of medical professionals and currently receiving treatment after testing positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). My family and I are asking for privacy at this time. We want to remind the public and all my fans to be vigilant, cautious and careful during this pandemic.” Some Facebook users claimed in the days following his death that media reports had “failed to mention that he was in the middle of battling Stage IV lung cancer.” Scott Adkins, the country singer’s publicist, told the Caller in an email that the claim is false, however. Diffie’s widow, Tara Terpening Diffie, also disputed the claim on Instagram. (RELATED: Did Bill Withers Call Donald Trump A ‘Great Man’ Before He Died?) “My husband @officialjoediffie did NOT HAVE LUNG CANCER,” she wrote. “His father passed, same name, November 2018 to stage IV lung cancer.

Fact Check: The claim started circulating widely in the U.S. around the time that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Americans wear face coverings in public to help curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular post, which says people should wear surgical masks with the colored side out when they’re sick and the white side out when they’re healthy, has been shared over 400 times. Surgical masks like the ones pictured in the Facebook post typically have a blue side and a white side. Dr. Seto Wing Hong, co-director of the World Health Organization’s Center for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Control, explained the correct way to wear a mask in January. (RELATED: Does The CDC Recommend Wearing Only Certain Beard Styles To Help Prevent The Spread Of Coronavirus?) “You see it has a blue color on the outside because it is waterproof and then you have the white on the inside, which is absorbent. So, if I cough, it absorbs it,” he said. “So you gotta wear it like this, the blue on the outside, the white on the inside.” Hong Kong’s Center for Health Protection advises people to wear the “coloured side/the side with the folds facing downwards” on the outside. So does the “Frequently Asked Questions” section of medical mask maker PriMED’s website.  Experts have stressed that people should follow the instructions from the mask supplier, according to The Associated Press.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A spokeswoman for Dollar Tree confirmed the company is not affiliated with the offer. Fact Check: The post, which has been shared over 1,600 times, masquerades as a promotion from Dollar Tree, saying, “To help our loyal Customers – We are going to select 100 Lucky families who can shop as much as they could for up to 1 hour and we will cover all the costs – To Win It Simply Share This Post & Comment ‘Thanks’ We Will Announce The Winners Within Next 24 Hours.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is no evidence that Dollar Tree is offering this promotion. The company hasn’t mentioned any offer to that effect on its website, nor has it posted anything on its social media accounts. It appears to be a scam. (RELATED: Did Goodwill Fire All Its Employees Amid The Coronavirus Pandemic?) Kayleigh Painter, a spokeswoman for the Dollar Tree, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that “we are not affiliated with the promotion/offer.” Dollar Tree has offered shopping spree promotions in the past. In early April 2019, the retail company held sweepstakes for one customer to win a $500 gift card and for 75 others to win $50 gift cards, for example. But, unlike the alleged promotion in the Facebook post, this offer did not allow customers to spend as much as they wanted on Dollar Tree’s dime. The Daily Caller recently debunked a fake shopping spree offer from the retailer Kohl’s. The wording of that fake promotion matches the Dollar Tree shopping spree giveaway nearly word-for-word, indicating they likely come from the same source.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Similar scams have been routinely debunked over the years. Fact Check: Claims that Tim Hortons will give away vouchers to celebrate the doughnut chain’s various anniversaries have circulated online since at least 2011. This particular post offers an alleged $50 coupon to everyone who shares, likes and comments on the Tim Hortons Facebook page.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “We here at Tim Hortons are giving EVERYONE who shares and comments FREE $50 Tim Hortons Coupon to celebrate our 56th Birthday!” reads the post. “Once you have shared and liked our page simply comment Done! We Will Inbox Your Coupon Within The Next 12 hours!” Yet, while the doughnut chain has been in operation for roughly 56 years as of 2020, there is no evidence that Tim Hortons has offered this coupon to commemorate the anniversary. No mention of the alleged promotion appears on the company’s verified social media accounts, and Tim Hortons has not issued a press release. The promotion appears to be a scam. A spokesperson for Tim Hortons confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the claim is false. In October 2011, a similar alleged Tim Hortons promotion promising $25 gift cards to users who filled out a survey and shared a link circulated widely on Facebook, according to Snopes. Tim Hortons quickly debunked the alleged promotion as a scam.

WATCH:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });   Verdict: False The video shows destruction from the March 2011 tsunami in Japan. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The National Ocean Service defines tsunamis as “giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea.” Data from the National Tsunami Warning Center shows that tsunamis have only ever rarely impacted China’s coastal cities. One of the most recent recorded tsunamis in the region hit Indonesia’s Sunda Strait in December 2018, killing more than 420 people, according to NPR. A video, posted on Facebook on April 20, shows water moving debris and entire buildings through what appears to be a coastal town. The caption claims the video depicts a tsunami making landfall in China, where the new coronavirus first emerged in late 2019 and has since sickened over 83,000 people. The footage actually shows destruction from the March 2011 tsunami that caused the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant meltdown following a magnitude nine earthquake. The view of the Tokyo-based Riken Foods factory reveals that the video was taken in tsunami-devastated Japanese city of Ofunato.

The quote originated on a satirical website. Fact Check: The article, titled “Michelle Obama to Oprah: Trump is Dumbest President in U.S. History,” was published on the website SCE News on April 1. It alleges Obama spoke critically of Trump in an interview with television personality Oprah Winfrey that was subsequently “leaked to the press.” “Donald Trump is hands down the dumbest president in United States history,” the article quotes the former first lady as saying. “He literally has the IQ of a grilled cheese sandwich. Minus the cheese, which rather obviously has been slipping off the proverbial cracker for quite some time now.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Had the former first lady actually made such comments, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on it. Obama also did not express any sentiment to that effect on her social media accounts, nor did Trump come up at any point in her most recent interview with Winfrey on Feb. 8. Such a comment from Obama would likely prompt a statement – or at least a tweet – from Trump as well. (RELATED: Was Trump Once Denied A Nevada Gaming License?) SCE News appears to have lifted the story nearly word-for-word from the satirical website Newsrapter.com. However, it deceptively leaves out the disclaimer at the bottom of Newsrapter’s article that states, “It should come as no surprise to anyone except a tater that, while everything written in this article is certainly quite plausible, if not probable, none of it actually happened.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/groups/834370886698377/permalink/1881937515275037/,https://www.scenews.com/michelle-obama-to-oprah-trump-is-dumbest-president-in-u-s-history/?fbclid=IwAR3aUpclae3M5nzj47KiPZ4WfdlSPD7gWY5d-jr568Mm5xFCxfgqk_VmyuM,https://www.scenews.com/michelle-obama-to-oprah-trump-is-dumbest-president-in-u-s-history/?fbclid=IwAR3aUpclae3M5nzj47KiPZ4WfdlSPD7gWY5d-jr568Mm5xFCxfgqk_VmyuM,https://www.scenews.com/michelle-obama-to-oprah-trump-is-dumbest-president-in-u-s-history/?fbclid=IwAR3aUpclae3M5nzj47KiPZ4WfdlSPD7gWY5d-jr568Mm5xFCxfgqk_VmyuM,https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Donald+Trump+is+hands+down+the+dumbest+president+in+United+States+history%22&oq=%22Donald+Trump+is+hands+down+the+dumbest+president+in+United+States+history%22&aqs=chrome..69i57.1386j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.instagram.com/michelleobama/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Trump%22%20%22hands%22%20%22down%22%20%22dumbest%22%20%22presidet%22%20%22%22Donald%20Trump%20is%20hands%20down%20the%20dumbest%20president%20in%20United%20States%20history%22%20(from%3AMichelleObama)&src=typed_query,https://www.facebook.com/michelleobama/,https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/ambassadors/oprah/tour/michelle-obama,https://www.whitehouse.gov/search/?s=%22michelle+obama%22+AND+%22trump%22+AND+%22intelligence%22+AND+%22negative%22,https://twitter.com/search?q=michelle%20obama%20intelligence%20(from%3ArealDonaldTrump)&src=typed_query,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/07/12/fact-check-trump-denied-nevada-las-vegas-gaming-license/,https://newsrapter.com/2020/04/04/michelle-obama-to-oprah-trump-is-dumbest-president-in-u-s-history/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e6929483908994a682878f8a9f85878a8a8394c885898b",Did Michelle Obama Call Trump The ‘Dumbest President In US History’ In An Interview With Oprah Winfrey?,,,,,

Canada’s Department of National Defense told people in the Toronto area that they may see military personnel and vehicles on the roads in early April, according to the Toronto Sun. The troops were traveling to Canadian Forces Base Borden to form a task force aimed at supporting the Canadian government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. “There are no tanks deployed in the streets of Toronto and the vehicles being used to move the troops from the Greater Toronto Area and to CFB Borden are military logistics vehicles, buses, and civilian pattern passenger vehicles,” Lt.

The video appears to have been taken in the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Fact Check: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced April 16 that the state’s stay-at-home order will be extended until at least May 15, asking people to stay home as much as possible. Under the original executive order, all nonessential businesses had to close, and all nonessential gatherings canceled, according to the Wall Street Journal.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Posted on Facebook on March 29, the video purportedly shows Brooklyn residents singing the song “Juicy” by late rapper The Notorious B.I.G., also known as Biggie Smalls, while under quarantine in their homes. Its caption reads, “Wowwwww. Brooklyn!!! This will give you chills. The entire good rapping Biggie.” The post’s claim is false, however. There are no people visible singing in the video, and many of the windows in the surrounding apartment buildings appear to be closed. (RELATED: Does This Video Show A Dolphin Swimming In A Venice Canal During The Coronavirus Pandemic?) The audio actually comes from a September 2010 YouTube video of rapper Jay-Z’s concert at Yankee Stadium during his Home and Home Tour. He paid tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. by having the DJ play the songs “Juicy” and “One More Chance,” according to MTV. WATCH:   Nor was the video taken in Brooklyn. The view of Central Park, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum at the beginning of the video indicates that it was actually taken in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, according to Reuters.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  While the video doesn’t show a real community sing-along, people across New York City did join together on April 16 to sing Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” from their windows, balconies and yards. The citywide sing-along came after the nightly 7 p.m. clapping salute to health care workers fighting the coronavirus on the frontlines, according to CBS 2 New York.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The Italian wildlife recovery center that examined the dead birds said they died from traumatic injuries sustained when the tree they nested in fell during a storm. Fact Check: The photos show hundreds of dead birds lying on the street in Italy, with the Facebook caption claiming they died “because of fucking corona viruse [sic] or fucking corporate 5g network.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    As of press time, the new coronavirus has sickened over 2.68 million people in 184 countries and regions, including some 189,900 cases in Italy, per the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Online conspiracy theories link the spread of the virus to the proliferation of 5G networks, but the World Health Organization, Check Your Fact and others have thoroughly debunked the notion. There is no evidence that COVID-19 or 5G technology killed the pictured birds. The photos come from the Italian news website Roma Today’s Feb. 4 article describing how strong winds in Rome downed a tree the night before, injuring one person and killing a group of birds that made their nests in it. (RELATED: Do Wind Turbines Kill 750K Birds A Year?) CRFS Lipu Roma, an Italian wildlife recovery center, later examined some of the dead birds and found that they had died from traumatic injuries. None of the dead birds that CRFS Lipu Roma examined showed signs of intoxication or poisoning, and the live birds that they treated were healthy apart from injuries, according to the wildlife recovery center’s Facebook post. “Many people ask us what could have happened and the most likely hypothesis is that the wind, very strong, which was already swaying the branches of the tree, made the hundreds of sleeping animals laid on it lose their sense of direction and probably they didn’t sense they were falling along with the tree,” reads a rough translation of the post. “If we also consider that it was dark and the animals were still sleeping it’s normal that they were caught off guard by such an unexpected event.”  Because CRFS Lipu Roma found that the birds actually died from traumatic injuries, and no evidence could be found to support the claim that the birds were killed by coronavirus or 5G technology, we rate this claim as false.

WATCH:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });   Verdict: False There is no evidence this “remedy” can cure COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state there is currently no cure for the disease. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The video shows two individuals in a small kitchen: one person leaning over the stove with a blanket covering his or her head and a woman speaking to the camera. The woman said that the other person is using an “African remedy” to cure COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “Turmeric powder, ginger, garlic and lemon — we cooked all these together and we steamed our head with it,” the woman said. “Coronavirus can’t get us. We know the African remedy.” The Daily Caller News Foundation found no scientific evidence that inhaling steam infused with these ingredients can prevent or cure the coronavirus infection. Claims that consuming ginger, garlic or lemon in some form can prevent COVID-19 have circulated online for weeks and been thoroughly debunked by fact-checkers. “A little warm moisture is not going to hurt these viruses,” Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, told The Associated Press. “People need to be very, very careful about this. You can have all kinds of misadventures if you are leaning over a pot of boiling water.”  Neither the WHO nor the CDC recommends this tactic on their respective websites. The WHO noted that while some home remedies might alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, there is no evidence they can prevent or cure the disease. The internet is replete with false claims that certain home or traditional remedies can cure the new coronavirus. (RELATED: Does Hot Water With Lemon Kill Coronavirus?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “The media has reported that some people are seeking ‘alternative’ remedies to prevent infection with the new coronavirus or to treat COVID-19. Some of these purported remedies include herbal therapies and teas,” reads a report from the National Institutes of Health. “There is no scientific evidence that any of these alternative remedies can prevent or cure COVID-19. In fact, some of them may not be safe to consume.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: Misinformation about shopping restrictions has circulated online amid consumers stockpiling necessities in anticipation of shortages during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular Facebook post claims the grocery store chain H-E-B, which operates more than 400 stores in Texas and Mexico, has banned adolescents from its stores, saying, “Starting April 6, 2020, no children under the age of 16 will be allowed in stores til further notice.” The post’s claim is incorrect. The San Antonio-based company has not announced any such age restriction on its website, and local news outlets have debunked the alleged policy. A spokesperson for H-E-B confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the claim “is not true.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Catfish Are Coronavirus Carriers) H-E-B announced on Tuesday that it would extend its temporary hours of operations in stores across Texas to opening at 7 a.m. and closing at 10 p.m. starting April 27.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Pelosi has only had one husband, Paul Pelosi, to whom she remains married. The story originated on the satirical website Tatersgonnatate.com. Fact Check: Nancy Pelosi is a popular target for misinformation, and this article appears to be the latest example circulating online. The article, posted on the website News For USA, claims that her fourth husband, Chester McNally Pelosi, filed for divorce because her “rules are too strict” and he “simply cannot handle the constant relapses into alcoholism.” But the story is completely false. Nancy Pelosi has only married once, to her current husband Paul Pelosi in 1963, according to multiple credible sources. They have five children — four daughters and one son — together, per The Washington Post.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is no evidence they plan to divorce, and a spokesman for Pelosi called the claim “fiction,” according to PolitiFact. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say, ‘It Is Dangerous To Let The Voters Decide Trump’s Fate’?) The News For USA article appears to be lifted nearly word-for-word from Taters Gonna Tate, a self-described satirical news website that disclaims “everything on this website is fiction.” News For USA does not label itself as satire and did not disclaim the fictional nature of the article, causing some readers to subsequently perceive it as real news. This is a common way misinformation spreads on the internet. Check Your Fact has debunked numerous viral claims that originated in satire websites.

The signs actually contain messages encouraging the public to practice social distancing. Fact Check: Featured in the viral image are two young health care workers dressed in light blue scrubs and face masks. They hold signs that say “Don’t let the democrats kill you” and “Ask for hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc!” The image has been photoshopped, however.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    NHS Million, an unofficial Twitter account run by some National Health Service (NHS) staff in the United Kingdom, tweeted the original picture on March 19.

(RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show WHO Lockdown Guidelines) Hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that has been touted by President Donald Trump to treat COVID-19, is in clinical trials to determine its safety and efficacy. The Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization to authorize the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine “for treatment of hospitalized adults and adolescents (weight ≥50 kg) with COVID-19 for whom a clinical trial is not available or participation is not feasible,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The antibiotic azithromycin has been used in combination with hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. On Tuesday, a panel of experts convened by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommended against using the combination outside of clinical trials because of a potential increased risk for heart problems, NPR reported. Zinc is a nutrient that “helps the immune system fight off invading bacteria and viruses,” according to the NIH.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: Social media platforms have become replete with misinformation related to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. This particular post alleges Trump announced a 30-day nationwide motorcycle ban that includes penalties for violators starting April 8.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Trump announced today, all motorcycle transportation is suspended!” claims the post. “If caught out on the road your bikes will be impounded, and a 500 dollar fine in any state for the next 30 days. It could be continued depending on the virus results.” The federal government has issued guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus in the U.S., including following the directions of state and local authorities. Many states have instituted stay-at-home orders that limit travel to only essential purposes such as buying groceries or seeking medical treatment. There is no record of Trump instituting a 30-day motorcycle ban. The Daily Caller reviewed April 8’s press briefing transcript and found no mention of policies aimed at restricting forms of personal transportation. Nor has Trump announced such a move at any other White House coronavirus task force briefings to date. Had Trump done so, the ban would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it, and the Department of Transportation did not issue a press release.

Fact Check: The video’s caption reads, “Italy has given up everyone out on the streets praying.” The same footage has been shared with similar claims by other users on Facebook and YouTube.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    With nearly 184,000 confirmed cases and some 24,600 deaths to date, Italy has been one of the countries hardest hit by the new coronavirus, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. However, the video does not depict an outdoor prayer in Italy during the coronavirus pandemic. Voices can be heard in the video speaking Spanish and referencing Plaza San Martin, a public square in the Peruvian city of Lima. The Daily Caller matched the statue in the video to that of national hero Jose de San Martin in Lima’s Plaza San Martin, meaning that the footage was actually taken in Peru. Peruvian politician Alejandro Muñante posted a longer live Facebook video containing similar footage on Dec. 7, 2019. The caption, which says, “Vigilia de oración por el Perú,” roughly translates to “Prayer vigil for Peru.” WATCH:   Bethel Informa, which is affiliated with Peruvian Christian broadcast network Bethel TV, reported on the event on its Facebook page several days later. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Coffins Of Italian Coronavirus Patients?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “Last Friday, December 06, hundreds of men and women of the Evangelical Christian community in Peru concentrated in San Martin Square to celebrate a united vigil of prayer and cry to God, under the motto: ‘Peru, Jesus Christ in the Only hope,'” reads a translation of the post. “Spiritual activity that also had the international participation of Colombian deputy Angela Hernandez and Adrea Vaca Barbery from Bolivia.” The new coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. On Jan. 31, Italy declared a national emergency and suspended flights to and from China after detecting its first two cases of coronavirus in Rome, according to Axios. Peru recorded its first coronavirus case on March 6, Reuters reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Trump’s campaign manager confirmed in a tweet that the image was fabricated. Fact Check:   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formally recommended on April 3 that Americans wear face coverings in public to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus, NPR reported. Shortly thereafter, social media users started sharing alleged screen grabs of Trump’s campaign website showing red “Make America Great Again” face masks available for purchase.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The screen grabs appear to be fake, however. No face masks could be found on the Trump campaign’s online store. Had Trump’s campaign started selling such products, it would have been picked up by the media, yet none have reported on it. (RELATED: Did Trump Tweet That He Won’t Send Stimulus Checks To People Who Tweet ‘#NotMyPresident’?) ABC News reporter Will Steakin debunked the masks as fake on Twitter after former Democratic congressional candidate Randy Bryce tweeted a supposed screen grab from the Trump campaign website. The claim appears to have originated with Bryce, though his tweet has since been deleted. Screenshot/Twitter “You knew it was coming,” read Bryce’s now-deleted tweet. “If I was a betting man I’d guess they’re not made in the United States. #COVID-19.” Brad Parscale, Trump’s campaign manager, also addressed the image on Twitter, confirming that it was fake.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has sickened more than 2.5 million people and killed some 75,400 others in over 180 countries to date, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. On April 2, the date of the image’s posting, at least 33 people had died from COVID-19 in Israel, after the death toll jumped by seven in a single day, the Times of Israel reported. The country has reported a total of 184 deaths, along with nearly 14,000 confirmed cases, at the time of publication, per the Israeli Ministry of Health website. The post’s claim that “the action of the lemon with hotter baking soda immediately kills the virus, completely eliminates it from the body” doesn’t hold up either. Per the World Health Organization, some home remedies may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, but there is no evidence they can prevent or cure the disease.

A viral video claims to capture the grim reality inside hospitals overwhelmed by coronavirus cases, allegedly showing the hallways of an unnamed New York City hospital filled with body bags of patients who have died from COVID-19. In recent weeks, people have widely shared the video on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. “Situation in New York hospital, No place to store the dead bodies … mortuary is full,” reads the caption of one such post. “For those who don’t understand the importance of lock down.” New York has become the epicenter of the country’s coronavirus outbreak, with more than 251,000 confirmed cases and 14,800 deaths at press time, according to the New York State Department of Health. (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Looting In Mexico During The Coronavirus Pandemic)  But there is no evidence to support the claim that the video came from New York. No news outlets picked up the footage, and social media users offer conflicting claims about where it was taken, including Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and BronxCare Health System in the Bronx. The Daily Caller News Foundation confirmed with Erol Schneer, a spokesman for BronxCare Health System, that the video was not taken at the hospital. A representative for Lenox Hill Hospital also denied in a Twitter direct message to the DCNF that it was their hospital in the video.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “The portion of the video filming the morgue space is absolutely NOT taken inside our morgue, or in the trailer outside of our hospital — which have been provided to all NYC hospitals,” reads the Twitter direct message. “Our morgue is locked and guarded by security at all times.” AFP Fact Check traced a name visible on one of the body bags in another version of the footage and established that the man died in Ecuador. The man’s obituary appeared in late March on a Facebook page for realtors in the Guayas province but has since been removed, according to AFP Fact Check. The Los Ceibos Hospital in Guayas’ capital city of Guayaquil released a statement on April 3 addressing a video circulating on social media that seems to match that of the Facebook post. A rough translation of the statement in part reads, “The corpses of COVID-19 patients remain in the hospital morgue, for at least 24 hours, before being transferred to refrigerated containers in the Parque de La Paz cemetery and others for their respective burials.” The health care system in Guayaquil has been overwhelmed by a surge in coronavirus-related deaths, according to The New York Times.

It is not related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Fact Check: The new coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and, as of press time, has sickened some 2.4 million people worldwide, according to The New York Times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Amid the ongoing pandemic, social media platforms have become replete with misinformation related to the virus. This particular post, which has been shared nearly 100 times, claims to show blankets used by Chinese coronavirus patients that “are being shipped to Africa in order to infect Africans with the virus.” “These are bundles of blankets used by CORONAVIRUS patients in China which are being shipped to Africa in order to infect Africans with the virus,” the post reads. “Please do not buy cheap blankets in the market in the next few months in order not to be infected with the virus.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Coronavirus Cannot Spread In Areas With Warm Climates) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the image has been found online since at least September 2010, roughly nine years before the new coronavirus first emerged. Online retailers, some of which export used clothing to African countries, include the stock photo on their websites. A study by U.S. government researchers found that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive for a few hours to up to several days on certain surfaces. However, the World Health Organization notes that the likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods and that the risk of catching the new coronavirus from packages from areas where the virus has been reported is low.  China exported approximately $13.2 billion worth of textiles and clothing to sub-Saharan Africa in 2018, according to the most recent data from the World Bank.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The shopping spree promotion is a scam. A Kohl’s spokesperson confirmed that the account has no affiliation with the retailer. Fact Check: Amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, retailers across the country have adjusted their operations to accommodate public health guidelines, ensure the safety of their employees and customers, and maintain revenue streams, Forbes reported. The post, which has been shared over 6,700 times, masquerades as a recent promotion from Kohl’s, saying, “To help our loyal Customers – We are going to select 80 Lucky families who can shop as much as they could for up to 1 hour and we will cover all the costs.” It requires social media users to like the page, share the post and comment “Thanks” to enter the giveaway.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Closer inspection of the Facebook page reveals that it is not actually from Kohl’s, however. It has the wrong name – Kohl’s Club rather than Kohl’s – and lacks a blue checkmark, which notes that the account has been verified by Facebook. (RELATED: Is Kroger Giving People $55 If They Share A Link On Facebook?) The Daily Caller confirmed with a Kohl’s spokesperson that the retailer did not offer this promotion, and the account has no affiliation. Kohl’s announced on March 30 that it will extend its nationwide store closures until “further notice.” This isn’t the first fake shopping spree offer that has circulated online this month. The Facebook page Kroger Club, which has since been taken down, posted a fake promotion that matches the Kohl’s Club shopping spree giveaway nearly word-for-word.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The link appears to be a scam. A spokesperson for McDonald’s confirmed that the coupon is “not a legitimate offer.” Fact Check: The post, which features an image of the supposed coupon, redirects social media users to a website that bears the McDonald’s logo and asks users to select their favorite “combo meal” from four options. It requires users to answer the question and share the link to claim the one-time coupon that’s allegedly valid from March 29 to April 30. “McDonald’s is helping out!” reads text on the website. “Just tell us what is Yor (sic) favorite meal and get 2 FREE big Mac Meals for a Month!” (RELATED: Can Inhaling Hot Air From A Sauna Or Hair Dryer Kill Coronavirus?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The link and its coupon offer are a scam, however. The website’s URL doesn’t match that of the official McDonald’s website, and it does not at any point provide access to a valid coupon or voucher. A spokesperson for McDonald’s confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the link is “not a legitimate offer.” Some McDonald’s franchisees have provided free meals to health care workers amid the coronavirus pandemic. Costa Enterprises, which owns 24 McDonald’s restaurants in northwest Florida, said in a Facebook post that it served more than 9,000 free meals to local hospital employees between March 18 and March 31. In-person dining at corporate-owned McDonald’s locations in the U.S. has been closed since March 16, according to a press release.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/groups/1189266264457232/permalink/3035908033126370,https://www.facebook.com/groups/1189266264457232/permalink/3035908033126370,http://www.mac-dona43cx45.com/?get-now&fbclid=IwAR2zPCr27Fn6fFR9nwksxuYU3gsFaXzh1qr3Nes1SAgoaGlR1VWcnzfuHhA,http://www.mac-dona43cx45.com/?get-now&fbclid=IwAR2zPCr27Fn6fFR9nwksxuYU3gsFaXzh1qr3Nes1SAgoaGlR1VWcnzfuHhA,http://www.mac-dona43cx45.com/?get-now&fbclid=IwAR2zPCr27Fn6fFR9nwksxuYU3gsFaXzh1qr3Nes1SAgoaGlR1VWcnzfuHhA,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/22/fact-check-hot-air-sauna-hair-drying-kill-coronavirus/,https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us.html,https://costamcd.com/locations/,https://www.facebook.com/CostaMCD/posts/from-march-18-through-march-31-we-served-9056-free-combo-meals-to-healthcare-wor/10158213359054207/,https://news.mcdonalds.com/McDonalds-US-coronavirus-update,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7a0e081f0c15083a1e1b131603191b16161f0854191517",Is McDonald’s Offering 2 Free Big Mac Meals To Everyone Who Shares This Link?,,,,,

There is no record of Ravi Nayak working at the Ministry of Home Affairs. Fact Check: Multiple Facebook users have shared posts claiming India’s Ministry of Home Affairs recently announced that only government agencies can post about the new coronavirus on social media.

However, the Daily Caller didn’t find any individual with the name listed in the Facebook post in that directory, nor does there appear to be any “principal secretary” position. A source within the ministry told The Quint that “the name and the designation doesn’t match anyone in the ministry.” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on April 14 that the nationwide coronavirus lockdown had been extended until May 3.

As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, PBS is legally prohibited from making donations to political organizations. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    President Donald Trump signed into law on March 27 a $2.2 trillion stimulus package aimed at helping relieve the economic burdens to Americans and businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic. “The virus bill gives 25 million dollars to the Kennedy center… 200million to PBS,” claims a viral March 30 post that has been shared over 16,000 times. “In return the Kennedy center donates 5 million to the Democratic party and PBS donates 25 million to the Democratic party.” The claims, however, are false. (RELATED: Does Nancy Pelosi’s Daughter Sit On The Board Of The Kennedy Center?) The CPB, which provides funding for PBS and other public media outlets, received $75 million from the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Those funds are earmarked for “fiscal stabilization grants to public telecommunications entities, with no deduction for administrative or other costs of the Corporation, to maintain programming and services and preserve small and rural stations threatened by declines in non-Federal revenues.”  A spokesperson for CPB confirmed to the Daily Caller that none of the CARES Act funds will go to PBS and that CPB does not give or receive donations from political organizations. PBS and its fundraising arm, the PBS Foundation, are both 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations. That means they are legally barred from making contributions to political organizations, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “A section 501(c)(3) organization may not make a contribution to a political organization described in section 527 (such as a candidate committee, political party committee or political action committee),” states the IRS website. “Nor may such an organization establish and maintain a separate segregated fund under section 527.” Had PBS or its foundation donated money to the DNC, it would have been picked up by media outlets, yet none have reported on the alleged tax law violation. Neither the PBS Foundation nor the DNC have issued press releases announcing such a donation. And, while the post is correct that the Kennedy Center received $25 million from the stimulus package, those funds did not go to the DNC. The Caller debunked a viral post making that claim in early April. “The Kennedy Center has never made a donation to any political organization, nor has it received a donation from any political organization,” Michelle Pendoley, a Kennedy Center spokeswoman, told the Caller in an email.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

There is no evidence 5G causes the new coronavirus. Fact Check: The conspiracy theory that 5G technology causes the new coronavirus has circulated widely online in recent weeks. A video recently shared on Facebook shows people tearing down a 5G pole and removing its interior wiring, with the caption claiming, “The Chinese are destroying the 5G poles as they are aware that it is the thing triggering the Corona symptoms.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    China started using 5G networks, which provide faster connectivity and downloading speeds for smartphone users, around the same time the new coronavirus emerged in the country, according to USA Today. However, there is no connection between the implementation of fifth-generation cellular networks and COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks,” the World Health Organization states on its website. “COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or nose.” (RELATED: Are Military Helicopters Spraying Pesticides Around The Country To Combat Coronavirus?) The Guardian, a British daily newspaper, originally published the footage on YouTube in August 2019, months before the COVID-19 outbreak and widespread 5G usage in China began. The video actually shows Hong Kong protestors dismantling a smart lamp post that they feared was fitted with cameras, sensors and other surveillance equipment, according to its caption. Kin Cheung, a photographer for The Associated Press, was present at the scene and took images similar to those in the video.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/maurice.lampkin.92/videos/1055161474868573/,https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/tech/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-trnd/index.html,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/coronavirus-conspiracy-theory-laboratory-report,https://www.facebook.com/maurice.lampkin.92/videos/1055161474868573/,https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/5g/what-is-5g,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2020/03/21/did-5-g-cause-coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic/2873731001/,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/25/fact-check-military-helicopters-spraying-pesticides-coronavirus/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&v=u1Ji7wonUhE&feature=emb_title,https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&v=u1Ji7wonUhE&feature=emb_title,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Hong-Kong-Protests/b33bc0d392264ab8addf8874340fbc3c/574/0,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Hong-Kong-Protests/1e28ecd858974dd19ba97b16097c4a98/577/0,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e3979186958c91a387828a8f9a80828f8f8691cd808c8e",Viral Video Claims To Show People In China Tearing Down A 5G Pole To Stop COVID-19,,,,,

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  While Democratic senators voted against moving the bill forward in earlier procedural votes over policy concerns, the Senate passed the final version unanimously. Fact Check: The image displays the names of 44 senators, all Democrats except for Independent Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, alleging they “voted NOT to send stimulus checks.” President Donald Trump signed into law on March 27 a $2.2 trillion dollar stimulus package aimed at softening the economic blow of the coronavirus pandemic. That economic stimulus package included $300 billion in direct payments to American taxpayers.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the post’s claim is inaccurate. The bill passed unanimously in the Senate on March 25, The New York Times reported. Whoever created the meme likely mistook one of the earlier procedural votes on the stimulus package as the final vote. In the days before the final vote, the Senate was roughly divided along party lines over some appropriations in the bill. Among the sticking points were oversight on the $500 billion earmarked for distressed corporations, worker protections and unemployment insurance, per CNBC. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer described the $500 billion fund as a “giant corporate bailout fund with no accountability – you wouldn’t even know what loans were made until six months later,” according to Vox. In a 47-47 cloture vote on March 22, the Senate failed to get the 60 votes necessary to move the bill forward, with all 45 of the Senate Democrats voting against the motion. The same motion failed again in a 49-46 vote the following day. (RELATED: Did Trump Tweet That He Won’t Send Coronavirus Stimulus Checks To People Who Tweet ‘#NotMyPresident’?) The Senate eventually reached a bipartisan agreement, which included stricter oversight on the $500 billion allocated to distressed corporations and municipalities, and passed the bill on March 25. Two days later,  it passed in the House, before being signed into law.  Millions of Americans have since received $1,200 payments from the federal government as part of the stimulus package, according to The Washington Post.

The article originated on a satire news website. Fact Check: The NBA indefinitely suspended the 2019-2020 season on March 11 after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert became the first known NBA player to test positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. (RELATED: Did LeBron James Tell The NBA, ‘Dump The Anthem, Or I’ll Quit’?) SCE News published an article March 23 that claims the NBA suspended the season, not because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but rather because Trump remains in office. It cites anonymous sources who supposedly confirmed that the suspension “has been in the making for months and that they were simply looking for a good excuse to shut it all down.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “The players, led by Washington Generals All-Star Power Forward Art Tubolls, held a secret vote prior to the beginning of the season to suspend the league for any credible reason until President Donald Trump resigns from office or is voted out,” reads the article. “Since much of the league is made up of Hollywood actor and musician wannabes, these millionaire crybabies overwhelmingly voted to approve the measure.” There is, however, no evidence that NBA players secretly voted to suspend games until Trump leaves office. The story actually comes from Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” Yet, while Bustatroll.org disclaims the satirical nature of its content, SCE News and other websites fail to make that distinction, portraying it as real. During a recent NBA Board of Governors meeting, commissioner Adam Silver said the league is “not in a position to make any decisions” about when games could resume, ESPN reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The graphic has been digitally manipulated. Fact Check: Duterte received widespread criticism when he warned in early April that people could be shot for violating coronavirus lockdown measures in the Philippines. Now, a viral Facebook post alleges the queen praised Duterte’s efforts to curb the spread of the new coronavirus in an April 6 televised address.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Pres. Duterte is the kind of leader who knows that way, goes the way, and shows the way. Filipinos are very fortunate to have him,” the post quotes the queen as saying. “Seriously, he looked so overworked. He may not be perfect, but he truly loves his country. Philippines doesn’t have the worst government. It actually has the worst citizens.” The queen did make a rare televised speech thanking health care workers and vowing the U.K. “will succeed” in its efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic on April 5 – not April 6, as the post suggests. The transcript of the speech shows that the queen at no point mentioned Duterte or the Philippines, however. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the graphic being shared in misleading posts has been manipulated. Inquirer.net, a Philippine media website, published a graphic quoting part of the queen’s speech on its Facebook page. (RELATED: Did Buckingham Palace Confirm Queen Elizabeth Tested Positive For Coronavirus?) “This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavor, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal,” the original quote in the graphic said. “We will succeed – and that success will belong to every one of us.”  The U.K. has reported over 115,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and over 15,000 deaths to date, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

He appears to be fictional. Fact Check: Italy’s National Federation of Physicians and Dentists (FNOMCeO) reports that at least 123 doctors in the country have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. At press time, Italy has reported some 172,434 confirmed COVID-19 cases and some 22,745 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Multiple Facebook users have shared a long statement, titled “Light In A Doctor’s Darkest Nightmare,” purportedly written by Urban before the 38-year-old doctor died from COVID-19 in Lombardy. “Never in by darkest nightmare did I imagine that I would see and experience what has been going on in Italy in our hospital the past three weeks,” the post quotes Urban as saying. “The nightmare flows, and the river gets bigger and bigger. At first, a few patients came, then dozens, then hundreds. Now, we are no longer doctors, but sorters who decide who should live and who should be sent home to die, though all these patients paid Italian health taxes throughout their lives.” The post concludes with Urban allegedly saying, “I am happy to have returned to God while I am surrounded by the suffering and death of my fellow men.” (RELATED: Do Blood Donors Automatically Get Tested For Coronavirus?) However, Urban does not appear in the FNOMCeO’s registry of practitioners or on the health association’s list of  doctors who have died from COVID-19 in Italy. Nor could any credible news reports about a doctor by that name dying in Italy be found online.  Urban’s supposed statement appeared on Magical Earth, though the website’s article has since been deleted. India Today debunked its claim that a photo showed Urban waving goodbye to his colleagues before his death. That image actually showed a team of doctors treating a coronavirus patient in Wuhan, China, according to Buzzfeed News. The alleged statement appears to have been first shared by Facebook user Jim McCarthy, who posted it on March 20, saying he “received this forwarded message today from a friend in Italy.” Fact-checkers have previously rated false claims related to COVID-19 that were allegedly passed along by friends, friends of friends or relatives, further adding to the post’s dubiousness.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Given there is no credible online record of a medical doctor by that name being active anywhere in the world or dying in Italy, Urban appears to be fictional.

The tweet has been fabricated. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Netflix docuseries “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” focuses on former Oklahoma zookeeper Joseph Maldonado-Passage, also known as “Joe Exotic.” His nemesis in the show is Big Cat Rescue owner and animal rights activist Carole Baskin, whose second husband, Don Lewis, disappeared in August 1997. Maldonado-Passage was sentenced in January to 22 years in prison for attempting to hire someone to murder Baskin, plus multiple violations of wildlife laws, according to the Justice Department. In late March, the former zookeeper requested a presidential pardon from Trump and announced a lawsuit seeking $94 million in damages from several government agencies and former colleagues, the New York Post reported. The alleged tweet, which has been shared over 250 times on Facebook, masquerades as an March 30 announcement from Trump, saying, “I would like to announce immediately that due to the Chinese Virus outbreak I have decided to pardon Joe Exotic (Tiger King) and will have General Attorney Barr look into the bitch Carol ‘Fuckin’ Baskin for the disappearance of her husband Don.” However, the tweet appears to have been fabricated. The Daily Caller didn’t find the announcement on Trump’s verified Twitter accounts, and ProPublica’s archive has no record of him deleting it. (RELATED: Was Joe Exotic Transferred To The Cass County Jail In Texas?)  The White House has not made any announcement about pardoning Maldonado-Passage. Nor has the Justice Department indicated it will look into Baskin or the disappearance of Lewis, whose case remains open despite being declared legally dead in 2002. At a White House press briefing on April 8, New York Post reporter Steven Nelson asked Trump if he was considering a pardon for Maldonado-Passage, mentioning that Donald Trump Jr. had joked about lobbying the president for the pardon.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Trump jokingly responded, “I’ll take a look.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

No mention of such research appears on the University of Havana website. Fact Check: Social media platforms have become replete with misinformation related to the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. One post recently shared on Facebook claims that eucalyptus oil vapor can prevent its spread.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Doctors of the University of Havana – Cuba confirmed and demonstrated that COVID-19 does not develop in environments where 1,8 Epoxy-p-methane is used, which is the antiviral, antiseptic and Eucalyptol bactericide better know as Eucalyptus in a series of tests in environments sprayed with hot Eucalyptol vapor,” claims the post. “Due to the heat of the vapor generated by the vapors, they recommend having branches of eucalyptus in the rooms, or vapors with eucalyptus oil or branches thereof to avoid COVID-19.” Eucalyptus is a type of tree native to Australia, and its leaves are often touted online for having medicinal properties. (RELATED: Does Sunlight Kill Coronavirus?) No news reporting or scientific research could be found to corroborate the post’s claim, however. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization do not list eucalyptus as an effective preventative or treatment for COVID-19 anywhere on their respective websites. Nor is there any record of doctors conducting such research on the University of Havana’s website. Joe Schwarcz, director of McGill University’s Office for Science and Society, pointed out another discrepancy in the viral claim in an April 14 article.  “The first clue that the science here is questionable is that 1,8 Epoxy-p-Methane is a nonsensical name, as anyone with any chemical background would recognize,” Schwarcz wrote. “The actual compound in eucalyptus essential oil is 1,8-Epoxy-p-Menthane, also known as 1,8-cineol. That missing ‘n’ makes a big difference. Methane and menthane are totally different compounds.” Dr. Warner Green, director for the Center for HIV Cure Research at the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, confirmed in an email to the DCNF that there is no evidence for eucalyptus vapor, adding, “Everybody is looking for something to help themselves and others which breeds these rumors.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  While some studies have found that eucalyptus oil can help alleviate symptoms of bronchitis and asthma, among other respiratory diseases, there is currently no evidence that it can treat or prevent COVID-19.

Fact Check: Goodwill Industries International is made up of a network of 157 community-based, autonomous nonprofit organizations in the U.S. and other countries. More than 96% of the network’s thousands of thrift stores have closed to comply with local and state government guidelines aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus, Goodwill spokeswoman Lauren Lawson-Zilai told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email statement.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    One viral Facebook post alleges that Goodwill fired — rather than laid off or furloughed — all of its employees. Getting fired for cause can jeopardize a worker’s ability to collect benefits, according to the Tampa Bay Times. “I just want to share what Goodwill Industries just did to all their employees,” reads the post. “They use this pandemic to fire all their employees instead of laying them off. They did say they would hire them all back as a brand new employee with no built up benefits or vacation time.” The post’s claim is inaccurate, however. While local Goodwill organizations across the country have laid off or furloughed employees, some operations have not shuttered. (RELATED: Is Dunkin’ Donuts Closing All Locations Over Coronavirus Concerns?) For instance, the Goodwill of Columbia Willamette, Oregon, said it will lay off roughly 2,600 employees due to financial constraints related to the state’s stay-at-home order. Some employees, like those in human resources, finance and operations and store management, will keep their jobs, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting.  “The majority of our Goodwills have transitioned their mission delivery online,” Lawson-Zilai told the DCNF in an email. “Many Goodwills are providing job preparation skills, job search techniques, job leads and placements, and job readiness skills, including resume writing, interview skills building, dressing techniques and more online to their community members.” Lawson-Zilai also said many Goodwills have pivoted their focuses to community partnerships. For instance, one Goodwill has partnered with a local dry cleaner to clean donated clothes that health workers can use as smocks. (RELATED: Are Thieve Using Face Masks Doused In Chemicals To Rob People?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Sandra Feno, the Facebook user who made the claim, shared a photo of a “Notice of Reduction in Force Due to Coronavirus” letter from the Goodwill of Central and Northern Arizona after numerous commenters refuted the veracity of her post. In a statement, that Goodwill organization said that it did “part ways with the majority of employees at each store” to ensure its financial stability. Those employees were laid off — not fired — and will receive a “severance package, which includes two-weeks’ pay, to help these team members in their transition to new employment,” according to the statement. “We truly hope when this situation passes, we will be able to rehire the majority of these employees,” concludes the statement from the Goodwill of Central and Northern Arizona.

Axios and Reuters have retracted their stories about the FDA granting such authorization. Fact Check: The company Biosphere claimed in a March 31 press release that they had received authorization from the FDA for the first serological coronavirus antibody test, according to CNN. The FDA uses emergency use authorizations (EUAs) to “make available diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices to diagnose and respond to public health emergencies.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Multiple media outlets, including Reuters, Axios and The Hill, reported on the announcement. (RELATED: Is Amazon Suspending All Deliveries Except For Medical Supplies Due To Coronavirus?) But the post and Bodysphere’s claim that the FDA granted an EUA for the firm’s COVID-19 test doesn’t hold up. The FDA does not include Bodysphere on its list of in vitro diagnostic EUAs and explicitly refuted that it granted such an authorization. A spokesperson for the FDA told the Daily Caller in an April 1 email that “no serology tests have received an authorization to test for coronavirus” when asked about Bodysphere’s press release. Since then, several serology tests aimed at detecting the presence of coronavirus antibodies have received EUAs, but none of them come from Bodysphere, according to the FDA website. “Serological tests measure the amount of antibodies or proteins present in the blood when the body is responding to a specific infection,” the FDA spokesperson explained in an email. “In other words, the test detects the body’s immune response to infection rather than the virus causing the infection. In early days of infection when the body’s immune response is still building, antibodies may not be detected.”  Reuters and Axios retracted their articles reporting on the company’s announcement. Michael Becker, executive vice president of strategic partnerships and initiatives at Business Wire, told the Caller in an email that Business Wire “removed the news from the wire” following “concerns” regarding it. Bodysphere later told Reuters and CNN that they had not received FDA authorization, with spokesperson D’Anne Mica telling CNN that “there was a misunderstanding.” The company’s CEO, Charlton Lui, also said in a statement that Bodysphere “believed when the manufacturer’s product was listed on the FDA Registry website, that was the Food and Drug Administration’s notification the Emergency Use Authorization was issued.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The company, which also lists N95 masks, sanitizing gel and hospital beds on its website, claimed to have done its clinical testing with a Zhejiang University-affiliated hospital in China, but a spokesperson for the university denied working with Bodysphere. (RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A ‘Hoax’ At His South Carolina Rally?) “I have confirmed with the affiliated hospitals of our university and got the feedback that they don’t have done (sic) any work with this company,” Zhejiang University spokesperson Ye Ying said in an email to the Caller. “As far as we know, our affiliated hospitals don’t have worked with any American companies on testing kits.” The Bodysphere website used to showcase photos of the coronavirus test with the words “MADE IN USA” and a FDA logo printed on the box. However, the FDA acknowledgment letter on the Bodysphere website lists the China-based firm Safecare Biotech as the manufacturer. “The kits are coming from China, so, they’re not coming from China, but the company is, everything, you know, is manufactured in China right now,” Mica told CNN.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The pictured article was published as part of a Texas newspaper’s April Fool’s Day edition. Fact Check: Maldonado-Passage, the main character of the popular Netflix docuseries “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,” was sentenced in January to 22 years in prison for attempting to hire someone to murder Big Cat Rescue owner Carole Baskin, plus multiple violations of wildlife laws, according to the Justice Department.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The March 31 image shows what appears to be a Cass County Sun article written by reporter Lacy Gross, with the headline saying, “Joe Exotic transferred to Cass County Jail.” (RELATED: What Percentage Of Federal Prisoners Are Locked Up For Violent Offenses?) Shawn Larson, editor and publisher of the Cass County Sun, confirmed to the Daily Caller in an email that the article came from the local Texas newspaper. The article was an “April Fools Joke” included in the Cass County Sun’s annual April Fool’s Day edition, according to Larson. However, the Facebook user didn’t provide that key context in the image or the accompanying caption, falsely insisting, “Its (sic) real guys.” Maldonado-Passage is currently serving his sentence at the Federal Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website. Larry Rowe, the Cass County sheriff, told the Caller in an email that Maldonado-Passage had never been held in Cass County Jail and that the claim was “fake news.”  In late March, the former Oklahoma zookeeper filed a federal lawsuit from prison seeking nearly $94 million in damages, claiming that he was, among other things, convicted on false and perjured testimony, according to The Associated Press. Listed among the defendants in his lawsuit are the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Department of the Interior and several witnesses in his case.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False No news reporting about such robberies could be found. The same post has been shared in several different countries without specific details about the alleged robberies Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The post, which has been shared more than 1,700 times, claims criminals are pretending to be part of a local government initiative to distribute face masks. The claim came amid the public health agencies in numerous countries recommending people wear face masks in public to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. “They ask you to please put it on to see if it fits. It’s doused with chemicals which knocks you out cold,” alleges the post. “They then rob you!! Please DO NOT accept masks from strangers. Remember friends, it’s a critical time and people are desperate, the crime rate will spike.” However, the March 30 post does not offer specific dates or locations for the alleged robberies, and similarly vague claims have also circulated in other countries in recent weeks. Both are tell-tale signs of an internet hoax. No news reporting about criminals using chemically treated face masks to knock people unconscious to rob them could be found online either.

Several media outlets have issued corrections and updates to their articles. Fact Check:  Berardelli, who served as the main priest for the Italian town of Casnigo, died from the disease caused by the new coronavirus in March, according to Insider.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    News outlets and social media users shared the story of Berardelli’s death after Italian news website Araberara claimed the 72-year-old gave up a donated ventilator to a younger COVID-19 patient, citing an anonymous employee at San Giuseppe Rest Home. The story appears to be false, however. Catholic New Agency (CNA) and Crux Now, both religious media publications, reported that associates of Berardelli debunked the claim. Benedetta Franchina, an employee at the rest home, told CNA that her coworkers would likely not know the details of Berardelli’s death because he died in a nearby hospital. “It is not like the way that some journalist wrote: that it was a respirator bought for him and then given by him to someone else,” Giulio Dellavite, a fellow priest and friend of Berardelli for over 20 years, said in an interview with CNA. Giuseppe Foresti, sacristan of Berardelli’s parish, told Crux Now that Berardelli “couldn’t tolerate” the ventilator because he had a pre-existing condition. BBC News also reported that “close friends” denied the claim that Berardelli gave up a respirator bought for him to a younger patient.  James Martin, the editor-at-large for American Magazine, called the story “inaccurate.”  Sources from the Bergamo Diocese have also confirmed that the story of the respirator (ventilator) is inaccurate. — James Martin, SJ (@JamesMartinSJ) March 24, 2020   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “Sources from the Bergamo Diocese have also confirmed that the story of the respirator (ventilator) is inaccurate,” he tweeted. Several news outlets, including The Independent and the Daily Mail, have updated or issued corrections to their stories about Berardelli’s death. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Coffins Of Italian Coronavirus Patients) Berardelli is among at least 60 Italian priests who have died from COVID-19, according to CNA.

Only approved medical tests can detect infection. Drinking water does not prevent people from contracting the disease. Fact Check: The post, which has been widely shared on Facebook, Instagram and other platforms, claims that coronavirus patients can develop 50 percent pulmonary fibrosis if they wait too long to go to the hospital. It also suggests that holding one’s breath for 10 seconds can determine if a person has the disease and that drinking water every 15 minutes prevents infection.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Social media users have falsely attributed the claims to Japanese doctors and Taiwanese experts, despite numerous fact-checkers debunking them.(RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A UNICEF Letter About Preventing Coronavirus) “Fibrosis is a late scarring process,” Loren Raunch, a community emergency room doctor at Antelope Valley Hospital in Lancaster, California, told Mother Jones. “You may have 50 percent of your lung affected by the virus, causing pneumonia or fluid in your lungs. But fibrosis – that is not correct.” Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The World Health Organization (WHO) also notes that people infected with the virus may experience “aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea” and, in severe cases, breathing difficulties. These symptoms typically appear within 14 days after exposure. The claim that Taiwanese experts developed a self-test for COVID-19 doesn’t hold up either. The Daily Caller didn’t find any evidence that Taiwanese researchers developed such a test online or that it’s a valid test, and the Taiwan Fact Check Center debunked the notion in a Feb. 2 article.  “This approach may be helpful in identifying persons with more serious lung disease,” Dr. Robert Legare Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, told The Associated Press. “But it will not identify persons who are infected and have mild to no symptoms.” The only definitive way to determine if a person has contracted COVID-19 is to take an approved test. (RELATED: No, Morel Mushrooms Are Not The Source Of Coronavirus)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “Drink some water every 15 minutes,” the post also states. “Even if the virus gets into your mouth, drinking water or other fluids will help wash it down the esophagus into the stomach. When the virus is in the stomach — the hydrochloric acid in your stomach will kill the germs.” The WHO Philippines Twitter account debunked the claim about drinking water every 15 minutes, saying, “While staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent coronavirus infection.” Some iterations of the Facebook post cite a Stanford University internal message board but, according to Stanford Health Care spokeswoman Lisa Kim, that attribution is false. “A widely distributed email about COVID-19 that is attributed to a ‘Stanford Hospital board member’ contains inaccurate information,” Kim told the Caller in an email. “It did not come from Stanford Medicine.” Matt Noel contributed to this report.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The video of the orangutan washing its hands was taken prior to the first reported coronavirus cases. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the 16-second clip actually comes from a video posted on the Florida-based sanctuary Center for Great Apes’ Facebook page. The original video, posted Nov. 12, 2019, predates the first coronavirus case reported in the U.S. by roughly two months. WATCH:  “Sandra has daily pools of water and really likes to wash things – her toys, her surroundings, and her hands!” reads the original caption. “Sandra loves to clean up! #orangutancaringweek #cleanhands #bubblesarebest.” (RELATED: No, Eating Alkaline Foods Won’t ‘Beat’ Coronavirus)  Featured in the video is Sandra, a 34-year-old orangutan who previously lived at zoos in Argentina and Spain, according to the Center for Great Apes website. The video of Sandra washing her hands was taken shortly after she arrived at the sanctuary in November 2019. The Center for Great Apes posted the same video of Sandra again on March 14 with the caption saying that the orangutan “definitely scrubbed her hands for longer than 20 seconds.” That new caption likely references the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) recommendation of thorough hand-washing as a measure to protect against COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The CDC also advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth, practice social distancing and wear cloth face covers in public to reduce the risk of contracting the new coronavirus.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

This is Timeless.” Verdict: False Retired teacher Catherine O’Meara actually wrote the poem in March. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The post claims that the poem about social distancing was originally written in 1869 by Kathleen O’Meara and later reprinted during the Spanish flu pandemic that started in 1918. Kathleen O’Meara, also known by her pen name Grace Ramsey, was a 19th century French-Irish biographer and novelist. The poem has circulated widely on Facebook and Instagram with that attribution in recent weeks due to its reflections on social distancing practices, which have been implemented during the current coronavirus pandemic. It begins with the line “And people stayed home” and goes on to describe ways of passing time in self-isolation, including reading, exercising and making art. But, contrary to the post’s claims, Kathleen O’Meara didn’t write the poem in 1869 or any other year. (RELATED: Did F.

The DESE has publicly debunked the claim. Fact Check: Missouri Gov. Mike Parson announced on April 9 that all public school districts and charter schools shall remain closed through the current school year in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. At press time, the state has reported 114 deaths and 4,388 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral image falsely alleges in a post that the DESE sent out a letter to parents saying their children must repeat the current school year, despite the DESE debunking the letter. (RELATED: Did Walmart Introduce A Staggered Shopping Schedule By Age Amid The Coronavirus Pandemic?) “Unfortunately Missouri case law on education makes it very clear that if students can not take the necessary final exams in a class room setting & they can not complete the curriculum that was established at the beginning of the 2019-2020 school year no one enrolled in a public school in the state of Missouri can be allowed to be promoted to their next grade level,” reads part of the fake letter. “This means that whatever grade each of your students started at in August of 2019 will need to be repeated.” The DESE published a statement debunking the letter on its Facebook page April 1, saying “This is simply not true. We could not be more disappointed that someone chose to use their free time to create this document, illegally using our department logo, and make a joke about something as serious as our students’ education.” There is no indication that the DESE or Missouri school districts intend to make students repeat the school year at this time. Many students have transitioned to online learning environments in response to schools stopping in-person classes, according to KSHB-TV.  The fake letter, signed by “Candice B. Fureal,” appears to be an April Fool’s Day joke but many social media users took it as fact amid school closures across the country due to the coronavirus pandemic.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A spokesperson for the company confirmed that the schedule was not real.

No-contact in-store payment for those with the Walmart app and no-contact delivery and pickup services have also been instituted, according to the corporate website.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2967080299981847&set=a.494997567190145&type=3&theater,https://corporate.walmart.com/,https://corporate.samsclub.com/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2967080299981847&set=a.494997567190145&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2967080299981847&set=a.494997567190145&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2967080299981847&set=a.494997567190145&type=3&theater,https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/blur-photo-background-snacks-consumer-product-1390845590?id=1390845590&irgwc=1&utm_medium=Affiliate&utm_campaign=Curly+Eskimo&utm_source=13749&utm_term=photo-search-top,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/27/fact-check-video-dolphin-swimming-venice-italy-coronavirus/,https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/03/18/latest-walmart-store-changes-to-support-associates-and-customers,https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2020/03/27/were-making-key-services-completely-contact-free,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#42363027342d300226232b2e3b21232e2e27306c212d2f",Did Walmart Introduce A Staggered Shopping Schedule By Age Amid The Coronavirus Pandemic?,,,,,

The claim originated on a satirical news website. Fact Check: Withers, the singer-songwriter behind the 1970s classics “Lean on Me” and “Ain’t No Sunshine,” died from heart complications in Los Angeles on March 30, according to The Associated Press. He was 81 years old.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Shortly after news of his death broke, people took to social media to pay their respects, with one Facebook post attributing to Withers a lengthy quote about Trump. (RELATED: Did JFK Jr Say Trump Would Be An ‘Unstoppable Force’ As President?) “I know, I know, I know, I know, people wouldn’t think I’m a supporter of Donald Trump, but I am. Donald Trump is a great man that has done the most of any president for black people,” the post quotes Withers as saying before his death. “Black unemployment is way down, crime is lower, everything is better under Trump. I’d be a fool to not support this guy.” A similar Facebook post linked to an article from the blog Best Online News, which contained the alleged quote and recounted how Withers allegedly left his $2 million estate to Trump’s reelection campaign. However, the Best Online News story is a word-for-word copy of an article from Bustatroll.org, a satirical news site. Yet, while Bustatroll.org clearly disclaims that “everything on this website is fiction,” Best Online News and other websites failed to convey that in their versions of the story.  There is no indication that Withers ever actually said the quote attributed to him in the post or left money to the Trump re-election campaign. No major media outlets have reported on the claims. The family also did not mention anything to that effect in its statement to the media, nor has it put anything on the musician’s official website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

There is no evidence to support the claim that eating alkaline foods can prevent someone from contracting the new coronavirus. Fact Check: The internet is replete with alleged treatments and preventative measures against the new coronavirus that has sickened some 1.9 million people worldwide to date.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A post making the rounds on Facebook claims that one way to “beat” the virus is to consume “alkaline foods” with a pH level above that of the virus, citing the Journal of Virology and Antiviral Research. It lists nine supposedly alkaline foods that can fight off coronavirus: lemon, lime, avocado, garlic, mango, tangerine, pineapple, dandelion and orange. However, viruses do not have pH levels, and following an alkaline diet cannot prevent someone from contracting the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to experts. “A virus itself does not have a pH,” Sarah Stanley, associate professor of infectious diseases and vaccinology at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health, told The Associated Press in an email. The pH scale is used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of aqueous solutions. Stanley also noted that it is impossible for diet to change the pH of blood, cells or tissue, as the body self-regulates pH levels, per The Associated Press. (RELATED: Does Hot Water With Lemon Kill Coronavirus?)  Dr. Warner Greene, professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology at the University of California, San Francisco, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that eating alkaline foods “would not reduce your risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection.” “First, this virus is primarily spread by respiratory droplets and an alkaline diet would certainly not increase the pH of mucosal surfaces of the nose and oropharynx or the respiratory tract sufficiently to neutralize the virus,” Greene said in an email. “Second, the values shown for pH of these foods seem wrong to me.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Indeed, the post lists incorrect pH levels for a number of foods that it falsely claims will help fight off the new coronavirus. For instance, it gives a pH level of 9.2 for oranges and 12.7 for pineapple, when they actually have pH levels roughly ranging from 3.7 to 4.3 and 3.2 to 4 respectively, according to Clemson University. The values it lists for avocado and dandelion exceed the 14-point pH scale, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. (RELATED: Can Colloidal Silver ‘Kill’ Coronavirus?) The Journal of Virology and Antiviral Research did publish a study in April 1991 about what happens to the pH of cells when rats or mice get infected with mouse hepatitis virus type 4 (MHV4). Yet, while MHV4 is a coronavirus, it differs from the human coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

Fact Check: Trump announced on March 14 that he had been tested for COVID-19 the previous day and expected the results in a couple days after coming in contact with Brazilian officials, some of whom later tested positive for the disease caused by the new coronavirus, at his Mar-a-Lago resort.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    White House physician Dr. Sean Conley released a memo March 14 saying the president had tested negative, Reuters reported.

Actually, it was hugely perfectly negative. And tremendous too! My doctor said it was the best and greatest score of anyone who has ever taken the test.” There is, however, no evidence that Trump ever made the statement. It does not appear on his Twitter accounts, and it could not be found in any transcripts of press briefings since Trump tested negative for COVID-19. Nor have any media outlets attributed the remark to him.

It is unrelated to the current coronavirus pandemic. Fact Check: Decades of political and economic turmoil have left Venezuela’s hospitals lacking basics such as water and soap and struggling to treat even common ailments, according to The Associated Press. The country reported its first cases of COVID-19 in mid-March and, as of press time, has at least 181 confirmed cases and nine deaths, per the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center map.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In recent weeks, multiple social media users shared a photo of money strewn on the street along with the claim that the Venezuelans who did it were sending “a clear message to the whole world that money is not enough when health is in danger.” (RELATED: Are Venezuelans Applying For Asylum Faster Than Anyone Else?) The image, however, does not depict money that Venezuelans threw in the streets in a symbolic gesture about health care during the coronavirus pandemic. Taken in March 2019, it actually shows banknotes scattered on the ground after a bank robbery in Merida, Venezuela, according to Maduradas. Segovia Bastidas, a Venezuelan reporter for La Septima Jornada, tweeted the photo on March 11, 2019, with an explanation that matches contemporaneous news reporting. For instance, Maduradas included Bastida’s tweet, among others, in its coverage of the incident.  #AHORA Vandalizaron el Banco Bicentenario de la Av. 3 en Ciudad de #Mérida y esparcieron en la calle billetes del cono monetario viejo.

Fact Check: Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the photo actually comes from “Endgame: AIDS in Black America,” a 2012 Frontline documentary featuring personal testimonies from people living with HIV and AIDS as well as input from experts on both. Johnson, who announced his retirement from the NBA in 1991 after testing positive for HIV, can be seen receiving medical treatment related to the virus in the documentary.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Social media users have shared the still image falsely claiming that it depicts Johnson donating blood since at least 2013, despite several news outlets debunking the notion. This particular post bears the watermark “#CFTTN,” referencing the Facebook page College Football Trash Talk Nation. That Facebook page disclaims “all posts are satire and meant to make you laugh” on its “About” page. (RELATED: Hoax Claims That Pepsi Products Are Infected With HIV) Under the Food and Drug Administration’s current guidelines, Johnson cannot donate blood, further adding to the dubiousness of the post’s claim. People who “have AIDS or have ever had a positive HIV test” are ineligible for donating blood and blood products, according to the American Red Cross website. At press time, the U.S. has reported 467,184 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 16,736 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center map.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Mahomes led the Kansas City Chiefs to victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the 54th Super Bowl earlier this year. As of April 9, no official date has been set for the Chiefs to visit the White House, though some members of the team and coaching staff have said they would be willing to make the trip, per Fox News.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The tradition of Super Bowl champions visiting the White House dates back to 1980, according to ESPN. A recent Instagram post attributes to Mahomes a statement about wanting to make such a visit, quoting him as saying, “I really hope it’s not changed. I’ve been looking forward to meeting President Trump for a while. That might offend some people, but oh well.” There is, however, no record of Mahomes ever making the remark. The Daily Caller didn’t find any credible media reports attributing the comment to Mahomes, and it appears nowhere on his verified social media accounts. (RELATED: Did Trump Donate His Presidential Salary To Rebuild Military Cemeteries?) The firm Steinberg Sports and Entertainment represents Mahomes.

No ban on the sale of alcohol and tobacco has been instituted in Memphis. Fact Check: Alleged news articles about bans on the sale of alcohol and other products have been circulating amid state and local governments issuing orders to close nonessential businesses in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular post claims Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland banned the sale of alcohol and tobacco starting on March 31 “due to Memphis TN residents not following covid 19 (sic) orders.” However, the article, which masquerades as a legitimate news story, actually comes from Channel22news.com, a website that allows users to create their own articles for pranks. The Daily Caller didn’t find any mention of Strickland banning the sale of alcohol or tobacco on the city’s official website. Dan Springer, the media affairs deputy director for Strickland’s office, confirmed in an email to the Caller that the claim “is not true.” In fact, Gov. Bill Lee issued an executive order in late March loosening alcohol regulations to allow qualifying Tennessee restaurants and bars to sell alcohol in closed containers through take-out and delivery. Restaurants and bars are considered essential businesses and can only “offer drive-through, pickup, carry-out, or delivery service,” according to the executive order. Some establishments that sell tobacco products, such as gas stations and food and drug stores, are also listed as essential businesses. (RELATED: Will Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot Ban The Sale Of Alcohol Starting In April?)  As of April 8, there are nearly 900 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shelby County, where Memphis is located, according to a press release from the mayor’s office.

Individuals cannot apply for food stamps through that number and must meet certain income and resource criteria to be eligible for them. Fact Check: President Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Emergency Response Act into law on March 18. That law aimed in part to relieve the economic burdens of Americans whose livelihoods have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic, including earmarking funds for SNAP benefits, among other measures, according to The New York Times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral Facebook post alleges that any person who calls a specific number can receive SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, saying, “If u don’t get food stamps call this number 18556354370 and sign up they are giving it to everyone.” The phone number connects callers to a toll-free helpline operated by the Virginia Department of Social Services (VDSS). Cletisha Lovelace, associate director of public affairs at VDSS, told the Daily Caller that individuals cannot apply to receive food stamps through it, however. “Applicants must meet certain eligibility criteria to qualify for food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,” Lovelace said in an email. “Applications should be submitted online at commonhelp.virginia.gov or through their local department of social services, not through the phone number listed.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) website notes that applicants must meet certain income and resource limits to qualify for food stamps.

Fact Check: The COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 87,000 people worldwide to date, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. With more than 139,000 confirmed cases and some 17,669 deaths, Italy has become one of the epicenters of the global outbreak of the disease caused by the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral Facebook post falsely alleges that the photo shows the bodies of Italians who have died from the new coronavirus in the street, despite the image predating the pandemic by roughly six years.

Travelers coming from areas with substantial community coronavirus spread must provide contact information and self-isolate upon entry into the state. Fact Check: In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order in late March requiring people traveling from states with substantial community spread, including Louisiana and New York, to self-quarantine for two weeks – or the duration of their stay in Florida, if that period is shorter.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The post appears to be referencing the checkpoints recently placed on Interstate 10 and Interstate 95 to screen such travelers, saying, “Florida border is officially closed! No Florida ID? Not a commercial driver? No entry. They are turning everyone around.” However, DeSantis’ executive order has not closed Florida’s border to people coming from other states. It actually requires travelers from areas with substantial community spread to complete a form that asks for contact information and trip details, in addition to self-quarantining, according to Florida Department of Transportation press releases. “The checkpoints are not a roadblock,” Beth Frady, communications director for the Florida Department of Transportation, told the Daily Caller in an email. “Also, Interstate commerce is in no way impeded by the checkpoints as commercial vehicles are exempt and do not have to enter the checkpoint.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Train Car With COVID-19 Marking) Indeed, Department of Transportation press releases state that the executive order “does not apply to persons performing military, emergency, health or infrastructure response, or persons involved in any commercial activity, including individuals that live in Georgia and commute to work in Florida.”  Nonexempt travelers who do not complete the form or fail to self-isolate can be fined up to $500, imprisoned for up to 60 days or both, according to the executive order.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

(RELATED: Viral Image Claims Coronavirus Cannot Spread In Areas With Warm Weather)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular post masquerades as an article from the Oklahoma City-based affiliate News 9, saying, “After multiple individuals near Oklahoma waters tested positive for covid-19, healthcare officials began testing for an aquatic carrier. Upon further investigation it was found that rivers in Oklahoma are full of catfish carrying the virus.” But the real article, titled “Oklahoma Next Possible Hot Spot For Coronavirus Outbreak, Experts Say,” does not mention catfish at any point. It actually discusses an uptick in coronavirus cases and deaths within Oklahoma and the measures that state and local officials have taken to curb the spread of the virus. “ACTUAL FAKE NEWS: If your friends share a fake graphic about COVID-19 and ‘catfish’ that looks like it’s from News 9, tell ’em it’s not from us,” the local affiliate said on Facebook. “It is a fake, 100 percent.” There is currently no scientific evidence that catfish can carry the new coronavirus or transmit it to humans. The World Health Organization notes on its website that the virus primarily spreads from person-to-person through respiratory droplets.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration also state that there is no evidence of food or food packaging associated with transmission of COVID-19. At press time, Oklahoma has reported 1,472 confirmed coronavirus cases in-state and 2 out-of-state, according to its Department of Health website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Beijing and Shanghai have reported 587 and 538 coronavirus cases respectively at the time of publication. Fact Check: The new coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and has since spread to 184 countries and regions around the world, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. A viral March 31 Facebook post alleges that two of China’s most populous cities haven’t documented any cases of the new coronavirus, saying, “The corona virus (sic) travelled entire world from Wuhan but it did not reach Beijing and Shanghai.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Coronavirus Cannot Spread In Areas With Warm Climates)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    That is, however, incorrect. The municipalities of Shanghai and Beijing had reported one and five confirmed COVID-19 cases respectively to the World Health Organization (WHO) by Jan. 20, according to the WHO’s first coronavirus situation report. At press time, Beijing has documented 587 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, per the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center map. Shanghai currently has 538. According to Johns Hopkins University, China has reported some 82,718 confirmed coronavirus cases and some 3,335 deaths. Worldwide, more than 1.3 million people have been sickened by the new virus and some 78,269 others have died.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  The sharing of coronavirus-related misinformation and conspiracy theories has coincided with the global spread of the COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In recent days, social media users have been sharing images of a train tank car labeled “COVID-19.” This particular post also appears to be suggesting that the U.S. government was behind the spread of the virus. “Pretty bold. Cargo train in DC,” reads the caption. “#Dothemathondaspread.” (RELATED: Does Sunlight Kill The Coronavirus?) Fuller versions of the photo reveal that the train tank car bears the markings of GATX Corporation, a global railcar lessor that operates in North America. The “COVID-19” label appears to have been superimposed into the image, as a video of similar tankers on the GATX website shows they do not have them. The American Railroad Association, which sets the standard food railroad car markings, requires reporting marks have “two, three, or four letters” and a “number of up to six digits,” according to Trains Magazine. Railinc, a company that manages a database for the North American train industry, has no record of the “COVID-19” mark featured in the Facebook post.  “We have no mark registered in our system that matches to COVID,” Steven Hinkson, a communications director at Railinc, told The Associated Press. “Further, the rules governing registered marks only allow for 2-4 alphanumeric characters. COVID would not meet that standard.” The new coronavirus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has since triggered a global pandemic. At press time, the new virus has sickened some 1.3 million people worldwide and killed some 78,500 others, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  There is no evidence to support the claim. No news reporting could be found to corroborate the events described in the article. Fact Check: With more than 132,000 confirmed cases and some 16,523 deaths to date, Italy has become one of the epicenters of the global coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. An article making the rounds on social media claims that more than 3,000 of Italy’s total COVID-19 related deaths can be linked to Kerr. “Italy arrest Doctor for intentionally killing over 3,000 coronavirus patients,” reads the headline of the story from News NT, a self-described “breaking news” blog. The deaths purportedly occurred after Kerr ignored “the approved medical procedures for treating coronavirus patients,” according to the article.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the story appears to be a fabrication. No additional news reporting could be found about the alleged murders committed by Kerr, and the story itself fails to link or cite any sources for its claim. (RELATED: ‘Our Only Hope Remains Up In The Sky’ – Did Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Say This About Coronavirus?) An internet search yielded only one mention of a doctor with that name apart from other outlets debunking the claim. The Tribune, a Bahamian newspaper, recounted in a March 4 article how a doctor with the same name treated patients after a 2013 mass shooting in the Bahamas. But there is no indication that this is the same man the News NT article claims worked in Italy with coronavirus patients. The photo of the doctor flanked by police officers that’s featured in the Facebook post is also unrelated to Italy’s coronavirus outbreak. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation discovered that it originated in a 2015 story from the Indiana-based Herald Bulletin. The man pictured is Dr. Eric Jones, a Pendleton, Indiana, physician who was arrested and charged with several drug-related offenses in 2014. Due to a lack of news reporting to corroborate the News NT article, we rate this claim false.

Fact Check: The viral video shows numerous emergency vehicles near a tall structure with smoke billowing from it in the Bronx borough of New York City. Its caption claims that the footage depicts the BronxCare Health System, previously called the Bronx Lebanon Hospital, catching fire on the evening of March 31.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Errol Schneer, a spokesman for the BronxCare Health System, told the Daily Caller in an email that the post’s claim had “no validity,” however. The fire actually broke out on the sixth floor of an apartment building on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, according to local affiliate ABC 7. Four women from the apartment building were transported to the nearby BronxCare Health System, where they were pronounced dead, The New York Times reported. No media outlets reported in their coverage that flames had spread to the nearby hospital. (RELATED: Do These Photos Show Directed-Energy Weapons Starting Wildfires?) New York City hospitals, including BronxCare, have faced significant staffing and equipment challenges amid the city becoming the epicenter of the U.S.’s coronavirus outbreak.

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts donated $5 million to the Democratic National Committee (DNC).   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Total out-n-out crooks!” reads the caption. “How are they any different from any organized crime????” Verdict: False As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the Kennedy Center is legally prohibited from making donations to political organizations. A spokesperson from the institution confirmed to the Daily Caller that no such donation has been made. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Kennedy Center recently received $25 million in funding from the coronavirus stimulus package signed into law on March 27. The post, which has been shared more than 1,500 times on Facebook, claims that the institution made a $5 million donation to the DNC. This claim does not hold up, however. The Kennedy Center is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. That type of nonprofit is restricted from making donations to any political organizations, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). “A section 501(c)(3) organization may not make a contribution to a political organization described in section 527 (such as a candidate committee, political party committee or political action committee (PAC)),” states the IRS website. “Nor may such an organization establish and maintain a separate segregated fund under section 527.” Had the Kennedy Center made donations to any political organizations, the tax law violation would have been covered by media outlets, yet none have reported on it, and neither the DNC nor the Kennedy Center issued statements about such a donation.  Michelle Pendoley, a spokeswoman for the Kennedy Center, told the Caller that the institution has never donated to a political organization. (RELATED: No, Coronavirus Stimulus Payments Are Not Tied To The 2020 Census) “The Kennedy Center has never made a donation to any political organization, nor has it received a donation from any political organization,” Pendoley said in an email.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The origin of the claim likely came from Twitter user Cari Kelemen, who sent out a tweet claiming that the Kennedy Center was donating $5 million to the DNC. She later clarified that she meant the tweet to be a “hypothetical.”  To clarify, my original tweet should have said: *Tomorrow* donates $5 M to the DNC. It was meant as a next-step hypothetical based on the way the DNC has used Planned Parenthood to launder taxpayer money in the past. I did not intend to confuse anyone. Apologies if I did. — Cari Kelemen (@KelemenCari) March 29, 2020  “To clarify, my original tweet should have said: *Tomorrow* donates $5 M to the DNC,” she tweeted. “It was meant as a next-step hypothetical based on the way the DNC has used Planned Parenthood to launder taxpayer money in the past. I did not intend to confuse anyone. Apologies if I did.” On March 31, the Kennedy Center announced that it would furlough approximately 60 percent of its full-time administrative staff for “at least” 5 weeks starting April 6, The Hill reported. The furloughs came just days after National Symphony Orchestra musicians were told that their paychecks would cease April 3 and that they would not be paid until the venue reopens, according to ABC News.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

In this case, the alleged statement attributed to her in the Facebook post appears to question her intelligence, with the caption saying, “AOC gets two Spock raised eyebrows for this comment.” The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that she ever actually made this statement, however.

Bernie Sanders for president.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Carter has not publicly endorsed Sanders or any other candidate in the 2020 presidential race to date. Fact Check: As the 2020 presidential election draws closer, some social media users have shared the news that Carter supposedly endorsed Sanders, who has in recent weeks lost his once-commanding frontrunner status to former Vice President Joe Biden.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The news stems from a March 7 story posted by the blog Liberty Inquiries that stated, “Former President Jimmy Carter slyly revealed who he voted for in the Democratic primary Monday — and it seems he’s still feeling the Bern.” The story claims that during a recent public discussion between the two men about “global peace and human rights,” Carter at one point turned to the crowd and asked, “Can y’all see why I voted for him?” But the blog post is a near word-for-word copy of a 2017 story from Talking Point Memos, a news organization that covers American politics. The information recounted in the Liberty Inquiries version is years old and has nothing to do with the 2020 election. It noticeably alters one line from the original — “Carter previously stayed mostly mum about the 2016 election” — to say “2020 election.” There is no evidence that Carter has endorsed Sanders or any other presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 election. Had he thrown his support behind any candidate, it would have been picked up by major news outlets, yet none have reported on it. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama Endorse Michael Bloomberg?) Sanders faces an uphill battle to secure the Democratic nomination as Biden remains frontrunner in the race, according to Fox News.

Fact Check:  The Reagan Library, located in Ventura County, California, temporarily closed its doors amid the U.S.’s coronavirus outbreak, according to the Ventura County Star. The April 1 Facebook post, along with an accompanying article from the website News Break, claims that the library is in danger of never reopening.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “The Ronald Reagan Library and Museum is asking for help during this coronavirus pandemic,” reads the article. “The Simi Valley facility has been closed since mid-March, depriving it of much-needed cash since it’s not federally funded.” That is not the case, however. The Ronald Reagan Foundation issued a statement April 2 debunking the claim. (RELATED: Did Reagan Appoint The First Black National Security Adviser, Hispanic Cabinet Member?) “While it is true that we’re currently not earning revenue from admissions to our museum, we’re raising more than sufficient funds from our supporters to re-open our doors as soon as it’s safe to do so for our visitors and the federal government allows,” John Heubusch, the executive director of the Reagan Foundation, said in the statement. The claim stemmed from a FOX 11 article that reported the Reagan Library, which is run by the National Archives and Records Administration, was in danger of closing permanently. The Los Angeles-based affiliate based its original story on a letter obtained by TMZ that said the library was losing $150,000 per week due to its temporary closure, according to the Ventura County Star. The letter was asking donors for money.  FOX 11 has since updated its article to reflect that the library is not in danger of permanently closing.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The video shows dozens of people running through a shattered storefront to grab armfuls of merchandise before fleeing the same way they entered. A group of armed soldiers can be seen navigating the store amid the chaos but noticeably don’t attempt to prevent any of the looting.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Ninja Cools TV, the Facebook page that posted the video, falsely alleges in a post that it shows “looting because of the “Covid-Virus (sic)” in the port city of Veracruz, despite the video being years old and unrelated to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Mexico Doesn’t Have Any Coronavirus Cases) The exact same footage appears in a YouTube video posted on Jan. 5, 2017, nearly three years before the COVID-19 virus first emerged. “ORIGINAL VIDEO: I didn’t upload it before because of the heavy size of the video,” reads a translation of the YouTube video’s caption. “Looting Chedraui Ponti in Veracruz, Ver. Yesterday, January 4, 2017; this was around 6:30 p.m.” Numerous media outlets, including CNN, CNBC and Bloomberg, reported how during that week Mexicans mounted protests and looted over a 20 percent hike in gas prices. Authorities arrested more than 250 people for robbery and vandalism across the country that week, according to CNN. This isn’t the first Facebook page to erroneously link the video to COVID-19 pandemic. AFP Fact Check debunked a similar viral post claiming the looting was in response to panic over the new coronavirus.

Eric Holcomb will suspend statewide liquor sales starting on April 5.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Holcomb has not instituted any sort of ban on alcohol sales. The claim originated on a prank news generator website. Fact Check: The image, posted March 29, appears to show the screen grab of an article about Holcomb suspending liquor sales in Indiana starting on April 5, with the caption asking, “Who’s ready for this?”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But the article actually comes from Portal24hs.com, a website that allows users to create fake news headlines for pranks. The joke, however, appears to be getting lost on some Facebook users. The Daily Caller didn’t find any executive order from Holcomb banning the sale of liquor in Indiana. Rachel Hoffmeyer, the press secretary for his office, confirmed in an email that the post’s claim was “false.” Holcomb signed an executive order in late March suspending the state law requiring at least 60 percent of alcoholic beverages sold at bars and restaurants to be consumed on the premises. That means establishments with club and restaurant permits can sell carry-out alcohol, according to the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission website. The governor had previously requested all bars, nightclubs and restaurants to be closed to dine-in patrons in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, according to local affiliate Fox 59.

Scott Fitzgerald Pen This Letter While Quarantined During The Spanish Influenza?11:59 PM 03/31/2020Trevor Schakohl | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsA Facebook post purportedly shows the text of a letter written by author F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1920 during the Spanish Influenza pandemic.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The letter is a satirical work written in March 2020. Fact Check: One of the deadliest disease outbreaks in human history, the Spanish Influenza pandemic lasted from 1918 to 1919. The outbreak is estimated to have killed more than 25 million people worldwide.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post includes a letter supposedly written by Fitzgerald to someone named “Rosemary” during a stay in southern France amid that pandemic. The purported letter discusses Fitzgerald’s feelings about the Spanish Influenza pandemic and also mentions his contemporary Ernest Hemingway. “Even the bars, as I told Hemingway, but to that he punched me in the stomach, to which I asked if he had washed his hands,” the alleged letter says. “He hadn’t. He is much the denier, that one. Why, he considers the virus to be just influenza.” The letter wasn’t actually written by Fitzgerald. Instead, it is a work of satire published on the website McSweeney’s Internet Tendency on March 13. The parody letter, written by author Nick Farriella, has even been highlighted by the official F. Scott Fitzgerald Facebook page, which is managed by his publisher and his estate. (RELATED: ‘Write Drunk, Edit Sober’ — Did Ernest Hemingway Give This Writing Advice?) “It was never intended to be taken as real,” Farriella told Reuters. “I’d like to think that people have responded to the optimistic sentiment of the message. That in these seemingly dark times, the line of true and untrue was blurred by the need for hope. I think that was something that was at the core of Fitzgerald’s life and work, an unwavering faith in better things to come.”  The “Rosemary” addressed in the satirical letter is likely a nod to Rosemary Hoyt, a fiction character in Fitzgerald’s 1934 novel “Tender Is The Night.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jay.nickeron/posts/2617182365228423,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html,https://www.britannica.com/event/influenza-pandemic-of-1918-1919,https://www.britannica.com/biography/F-Scott-Fitzgerald,https://www.facebook.com/jay.nickeron/posts/2617182365228423,https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/this-side-of-paradise-a-letter-from-f-scott-fitzgerald-quarantined-in-the-south-of-france,https://www.facebook.com/FitzgeraldOfficial/posts/2985623154791961?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBHVercsymlCn9CCVFx3Vxk14f5ELVYXlLjoasOAE5EaexNRnlc9y_g4dWvlGDBFK3wvGkOaju34Ow4QiQy1kRO0_kNPvKqHcAX7ipPhrrBsv_K1NizJMe3md89TS6sFx376NxoaYzEpxmfkuUxrfEBVGXGm4nucLdSI4baaNZpEDPa7WiluwL2dEzNJnBC61Tki5oiEt2VOZVT731iN_7XknGazY5b2p3-Z6-1HEGg048H8JOpDt2jA9mXn3fB5FX4upDZH1Xay7xANRDQIn1Suesd0o1InYTGTTzcmxwMOqR5-e7_STWb72eh7ggiDMIxJ-iAe8crSwZasM4Njs2L-g&__tn__=-R,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-quarantine-fitzgerald-lette/false-claim-this-is-a-1920-letter-from-scott-fitzgerald-in-quarantine-during-the-spanish-influenza-idUSKBN21733X,https://www.amazon.com/Tender-Night-F-Scott-Fitzgerald/dp/068480154X,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#40343225362f32002421292c3923212c2c25326e232f2d",Did F.

The alleged news article comes from a prank news website. Fact Check: Screen grabs of alleged news articles about bans on alcohol sales have been circulating widely amid state and local governments issuing orders to close non-essential businesses to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular post makes the claim that Illinois banned the sale of beer and other alcohol starting March 30, saying, “Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker announced on Sunday, under the request of Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, that all beer and alcohol sales be temporarily suspended until further notice.” But Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has not announced a measure to that effect at any point. Had he done so, it would have been picked up by local media outlets, yet none have reported on it. The Daily Caller previously debunked the claim that Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot banned the sale of alcohol in Cook County. The Illinois Liquor Control Commission released a statement addressing rumors of the statewide alcohol ban on March 30.

The U.K. government is not sending text messages notifying people of fines they have incurred for violating the stay-at-home order. Fact Check: On March 23, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered people not to leave their homes except for limited purposes, including shopping for food and medicine and exercising once a daily, in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. The U.K. government said that it would send a text message to people throughout the country informing them of these rules.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral Facebook post contains two text messages allegedly sent by the British government. The top text message matches the real one sent to U.K. residents with registered phone numbers. “GOV.UK CORONAVIRUS ALERT,” reads the authentic text message. “New rules in force now: you must stay at home. More info & Exceptions at gov.uk/coronavirus Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.” The second text message, though also attributed in the post to the sender “UK_Gov,” was not sent by the British government, however. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Tom Hanks Quarantined In Australia With Wilson The Volleyball?) “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines,” it reads. “Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.”  The British government stated in a March 25 Facebook post that only a one text message identical to the top one had been sent.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “UK Government has sent out only one text message on new rules about staying at home to prevent the spread of #coronavirus (see below),” reads the Facebook post. “If you see others claiming to be from UK Government, they are false.” Individuals who break the stay-at-home order rules may receive an on-the-spot fine of £60 from police officers, though that fine can go down to £30 if paid within two weeks, according to the U.K. government’s website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217242200786425&set=gm.879876962474219&type=3&theater,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/full-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others/full-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coronavirus-sms-messages,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217242200786425&set=gm.879876962474219&type=3&theater,https://www.gov.uk/government/news/coronavirus-sms-messages,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/13/fact-check-tom-hanks-coronavirus-australia-wilson-volleyball/,https://www.facebook.com/UKgovernment/photos/a.438874682931631/1666859916799762/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/UKgovernment/photos/a.438874682931631/1666859916799762/?type=3&theater,https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/full-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others/full-guidance-on-staying-at-home-and-away-from-others,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe8a8c9b88918cbe9a9f9792879d9f92929b8cd09d9193",Is The British Government Sending People Fines Via Text For Violating Coronavirus Stay-At-Home Rules?,,,,,

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The Daily Caller didn’t find any evidence that any of Pelosi’s four daughters sit on the board of the Kennedy Center. A spokeswoman for the Kennedy Center confirmed that Pelosi’s children have no affiliation with the institution. Fact Check: The Kennedy Center was allocated $25 million as part of the federal government’s $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that was signed into law on March 27. Shortly thereafter, viral claims related to the Kennedy Center started circulating on social media platforms.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “So Nancy’s daughter is on the board of the Kennedy Center,” claims one Facebook post. “So that’s why it was so important to send them all that money.” (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Hide $25 Million For Congressional Pay Raises In The Coronavirus Stimulus Bill?) The House speaker has five children, according to the Washington Post. Of her children, she has four daughters: Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline and Alexandra. There is no evidence that any of her daughters – or her son, for that matter – sit on the Kennedy Center’s board. The Kennedy Center website does not list any of their names under its board of trustees or its “Executive Leadership and Artistic Leadership.” A search for their names on the entire Kennedy Center website turned up no matchers either. Nor do they appear to sit on the governing boards of the Washington National Opera or the National Symphony Orchestra, both of which are closely affiliated with the Kennedy Center.  The list of the Washington National Opera’s Governance Board does not show any of the names of Pelosi’s daughters, and neither does that of the Women’s Committee of the National Opera. The National Symphony Orchestra Board of Directors does not have Pelosi’s children among its members, according to the Kennedy Center website. Nor does its list of national trustees.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  It’s worth noting that the Kennedy Center does list Pelosi as an ex-officio member of its board of trustees due to her position as House speaker. Other members include House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Michelle Pendoley, a spokeswoman for the Kennedy Center, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that none of the House speaker’s children are affiliated with the institution.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Cotopaxi was discovered underwater in the 1980s but was only identified recently. Fact Check: The steamer ship and its 32-person crew disappeared en route to Havana, Cuba from Charleston, South Carolina in 1925, according to the Marine Historical Society of Detroit.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The article, which was published on the website True Blog in November 2019, claims that Cuban authorities intercepted the S.S. Cotopaxi floating west of Cuba more than 90 years after its disappearance. People have started sharing the article on Facebook again in recent months. “The captain’s logbook confirmed that this is the SS Cotopaxi ship but did not even provide a clue as to the years in which the ship disappeared,” the article claims. “The strangest detail is that not even a skeleton was found on the ship. It seems like all the people disappeared from that ship.” Contrary to the article’s claims, the steamer ship was actually found about 35 years ago sunken off the coast of St. Augustine, Florida, according to Smithsonian Magazine. The wreck was recently confirmed to be that of the S.S. Cotopaxi by researchers, including National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration marine biologist Michael Barnette. For years, the ship’s disappearance had been connected to the legends of the Bermuda Triangle. However, Barnette debunked that theory as well.

The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that people can catch the COVID-19 virus “no matter how sunny or hot the weather is.” Fact Check:  Sunlight has been cited as an alleged prevention method against contracting the new coronavirus by multiple social media users, with this particular post claiming, “Sunlight kills the Coronaviru [sic] (COVID-19) 15 minutes & you’re good to go”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But like many other supposed prevention methods making the rounds online, there is no evidence it is actually effective. The speculation about using sunlight to kill the new virus seems to stem from it containing ultraviolet (UV) rays that can kill viruses at certain levels. However, the level of UV needed to kill viruses far exceeds that found in sunlight, according to USA Today. “Ultraviolet (UV) is able to kill COVID-19 if it is exposed to the concentrated UV ray in certain amounts of time and distance,” Dr. Pokrath Hansasuta, an assistant professor of virology in Chulalongkorn University’s Department of Microbiology, told AFP Fact Check. “However, that level of UV exposure is harmful to human’s skin. Most likely, it will be in a light bulb or lamp as the natural UV from the sun is not strong enough to kill it.” The World Health Organization (WHO) advises against using man-made UV sources to kill the COVID-19 virus because they can cause skin irritation. It also notes on its website that people can catch the disease “no matter how sunny or hot the weather is.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not mention sunlight as a means of preventing or treating the virus either. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Coronavirus Cannot Spread In Areas With Warm Climates)  There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-16 currently available, according to the WHO. The CDC website states that the best way for individuals to protect themselves from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is to wash their hands thoroughly, practice social distancing and avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth after touching surfaces.

Greg Abbott has banned all travelers coming into Texas from Louisiana.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “It just got REAL REAL,” reads the caption. Verdict: False There is no travel ban on people coming from Louisiana. The executive order requires that people traveling by car from Louisiana self-quarantine for 14 days upon entering Texas. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Abbott expanded quarantine orders for travelers entering Texas on March 29 to include “every person who enters the State of Texas through roadways from Louisiana.” The mandate, which went into effect on March 30, requires people traveling by car from Louisiana to self-quarantine for 14 days upon entry into Texas. The same day that Abbott made the announcement, local journalist Jason Whitely tweeted out what he believed to be a summary of the expanded quarantine orders. That tweet was later screen grabbed and posted on Facebook. “#BREAKING: Governor @GregAbbott_TX issues executive order banning people from traveling into Texas from Louisiana,” he tweeted. “State troopers will stop motorists. Commercial activity, emergency response or critical infrastructure responsibilities is okay.” There is, however, no mention of a travel ban on travelers entering Texas from Louisiana in the governor’s executive order. A spokesperson for Abbott’s office confirmed to the Daily Caller in a phone interview that “no ban on travel between the two states” exists.  Whitely amended his statement in a subsequent tweet.  UPDATE: *Travel from Louisiana to Texas is NOT banned. Anyone entering by car must quarantine for 14-days.* https://t.co/PAtq2ja2j0 — Jason Whitely (@JasonWhitely) March 29, 2020   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “UPDATE: *Travel from Louisiana to Texas is NOT banned,” he tweeted. “Anyone entering by care must quarantine for 14-days.*” (RELATED: Does This Video Show Military Vehicles Arriving In New York City During The Coronavirus Pandemic?) The Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) will enforce the quarantine mandate, which requires travelers to provide a quarantine location and other information.

Fact Check: Two Italians, Cristian Fracassi and Alessandro Romaioli of the startup Isinnova, used their 3D printer to make respiratory valves, after a hospital near them began running low on the part and was unable to get more from the manufacturer, which was facing its own shortage, according to Business Insider.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral image alleges that Intersurgical, the company that makes the valves, threatened to sue them for reverse engineering and 3D printing the patented valve. It also claims that the valves cost approximately $11,000. “Italians Found Way to 3-D Print Key Ventilator Piece for $1 to Help Battle Coronavirus,” reads the main text, which is also the headline from a March 18 Common Dreams article. “So The Company is Threatening To Sue.” (RELATED: Does This Video Show A Dolphin Swimming In A Venice Canal During The Coronavirus Pandemic?)  These claims, however, are not true. While Intersurgical did refuse Fracassi and Romaioli the patented schematics for the valve, the company did not threaten legal action. Romaioli confirmed in an interview with The Verge that there was no threat of a lawsuit. “I talked to an operator who told me he couldn’t give me the files, but after that we didn’t receive anything from the original company — so I can assure you we didn’t get any threat,” Romaioli told The Verge. “They said they couldn’t give us the file because it’s company property, but that’s all.”  Intersurgical Managing Director Charles Bellm also said in a statement to The Verge that the reports of threatened legal action were “totally incorrect.” He debunked the claim that the valves cost $11,000, as well. “Just to confirm that recent reports from Italy are totally incorrect, we were contacted at the end of last week for manufacturing details of a valve accessory but could not supply these due to medical manufacturing regulations, we have categorically not threatened to sue anyone involved,” Bellm said. “The valve is an accessory supplied as part of a CPAP Hood system which alone costs a few euros.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Massimo Temporelli, the physicist who recruited the pair to 3D print the valves, was quoted during an interview with Business Insider Italia as saying that the device maker threatened then with an infringement claim. The Facebook post’s claim appears to have stemmed that comment. But the physicist, who wasn’t directly involved in Fracassi and Romaioli’s call with Intersurgical, offered a different account in a later interview with The Verge, saying, “Let’s say the risk to be sued exists since they bypassed a patent, but that’s it.” Italy has been hit hard by the new coronavirus, with more than 105,700 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 12,428 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the new coronavirus can be transmitted in all areas. Fact Check: At the time of publication, the new coronavirus has spread to 180 countries and regions and sickened some 838,061 people globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map. Amid the global pandemic, some social media users have claimed the new virus cannot spread in areas with warm climates.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Corona cannot spread in warm weather only cold countries,” says one post shared on Facebook. “When the sun is in the virus endemic area, the virus will completely disappear.” WHO, however, has documented cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus in numerous countries close to the equator, where the climate is typically warmer. Among those countries are Brazil, Ecuador and Indonesia. “From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather,” the WHO website states on its “Myth Busters” page. (RELATED: Does Avoiding Ice Cream And Other Cold Food Products Help To Prevent Contracting Coronavirus?) While there is no evidence that a warmer climate can prevent the spread of the virus, a recent study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology did find that there might be a link between warm weather and a slower rate of transmission. But even this study, which was shared with the public before it was peer-reviewed, noted transmission is still possible, saying, “Our results in no way suggest that 2019-nCoV would not spread in warm humid regions and effective public health interventions should be implemented across the world to slow down the transmission of 2019-nCoV.”  The post also made numerous dubious claims about how to prevent transmission of COVID-19: drinking hot water, eating certain foods and avoiding ice water, among others. There is no evidence to support these claims, and the theories about garlic, ginger, cold water and sunlight have been thoroughly debunked.

Verdict: False Amazon is not suspending all deliveries except for medical supplies. The company is temporarily suspending shipments of non-essential items to their warehouses for third-party sellers who use Fulfillment by Amazon. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The rumor that Amazon is suspending the shipment of all non-medical supplies began circulating on social media amid countless companies adjusting their operations in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The popular e-commerce website ships more than 2.5 billion packages a year in the United States, according to Forbes. Amazon is not, however, suspending all deliveries except for medical supplies. No notice of such a move can be found on the website, and products can still be purchased online. The confusion appears to stem from news that broke earlier in March that Amazon would be limiting the shipment of non-essential items from third-party sellers to its warehouses in the United States and United Kingdom. The freeze, instituted March 17, will be effective through at least April 5, according to Reuters. “We are seeing increased online shopping and as a result some products such as household stapes and medical supplies are out of stock,” said an Amazon spokesperson in a statement to The Hill. “With this in mind, we are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so we can more quickly receive, restock and ship these products to customers.”  Amazon includes baby products, health and household items, beauty and personal care, grocery, industrial and scientific, and pet supplies among its categories of essential products. (RELATED: Is Dunkin’ Donuts Closing All Locations Over Coronavirus Concerns?) The policy means third-party sellers who pay to store and ship their products through the Fulfillment by Amazon program will temporarily be unable to send their products to fulfillment centers if they are not deemed essential or in high demand. The same freeze applies to vendors who wholesale their products to Amazon, according to Business Insider.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  But that does not mean Amazon is suspending all deliveries except for medical supplies. Consumers can purchase and receive non-essential products from Amazon, but the products may become unavailable as existing warehouse stock gets depleted, according to Reuters. Third-party sellers can still sell non-essential products on Amazon’s website and fulfill the shipments themselves, per a help document on Amazon.com. We rate the claim false.

Verdict: False The image misstates the timeline for most of the listed diseases and leaves out context for the others. No evidence could be found to establish a pattern between the outbreaks and election years. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Some social media users have spread a conspiracy theory on Facebook and Twitter that connects disease outbreaks to U.S. political election years. “Every election year has a disease,” reads one post. “Coincidences? NEVER.” The post links severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to 2004, avian flu to 2008, swine flu to 2010, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) to 2012, Ebola to 2014 and 2018, Zika virus to 2016 and COVID-19 to 2020. But the years listed for many of the outbreaks are inaccurate, and there’s no evidence of a specific link between them and U.S. election years. (RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A ‘Hoax’ At His South Carolina Rally?) The year linked to SARS, a disease caused by a strain of coronavirus, is 2004, when incumbent Republican President George W. Bush won reelection. However, the outbreak was first reported in February 2003, about 21 months before Election Day, and contained by July 2003, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  Per the WHO, the avian flu presumably referenced in the post, H5N1, dates back to at least 1997, when the first human cases were reported in Hong Kong. North America didn’t see a case until January 2014 in Canada. Human infections of this virus are rare, but approximately 60 percent of individuals who contract it die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Swine flu (H1N1) first emerged in the U.S. in April 2009, nearly 19 months before the 2010 midterm elections, and later became a pandemic. But, according to the CDC’s timeline, virus activity levels had “declined to levels below baseline, but persisted for several more months at lower levels” by January 2010. The outbreak ended in early August 2010, according to WHO.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  While MERS did first emerge in Saudi Arabia in September 2012, it wasn’t until 2014 that two cases appeared in the U.S., according to the CDC. All cases of MERS were in the Arabian Peninsula the year that President Barack Obama won reelection against then-former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. There was an Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 but, per the CDC website, only 11 people in the U.S. were ever treated for the disease. In 2018, outbreaks were limited to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. Zika virus has been documented in humans since 1952, according to the WHO. The post links the virus to 2016, and that more or less coincides with the most recent global outbreak, but it was first reported in the Americas in 2015. Since being first reported in China in late 2019, the new coronavirus has spread to more than 179 countries and regions, including the U.S., where some 165,874 confirmed cases have been documented. The pandemic has become a major talking point for candidates and some states have postponed their primaries, but the notion that the virus is specifically tied to the 2020 election or a “#ManufacturedCrisis” is incorrect. The post doesn’t list any disease outbreak for 2006, a midterm election year, seemingly contradicting its own claim that “every election year has a disease.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Tom Hanks Quarantined In Australia With Wilson The Volleyball?) The Daily Caller News Foundation searched for evidence that specifically links the disease outbreaks to U.S. elections but failed to find anything supporting the tenuous claim. Elections occur every other year in the U.S., giving any disease outbreak a 50 percent chance coinciding with one. Without further evidence establishing a pattern between outbreaks and election years, it can be safely assumed that a disease outbreak in an election year is merely a coincidence.

Pritzker has ordered all schools in the state to close for the remainder of the year in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Pritzker has only ordered all Illinois schools to close through April 7 at the time of publication. Fact Check: In addition to issuing a statewide stay-at-home order, Pritzker has also mandated that all public and private schools in Illinois must remain closed through April 7. That executive order, signed March 20, marks an extension beyond the previously required date of March 30.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image in the Facebook post was shared on March 27. It cites a local CBS affiliate news station as the source of its claims and purports that Pritzker has barred all schools in the state from opening again for the rest of the year. “Parents of all K-12 students may decide if they want their child to repeat their current grade or go fourth to the next grade,” the image states. “All graduating classes will still be able to receive a diploma if their parents decide that they shall continue to the next grade.” Pritzker has not prohibited Illinois schools from reopening before next year, however. No measure to that effect is included in any of the coronavirus-related executive orders he has issued. As of Tuesday morning, Pritzker has only required Illinois schools to remain closed until April 7. “We have not called off schools for the remainder of the year,” Jordan Abudayyeh, press secretary for Abbott’s office, said in an email to the Daily Caller. (RELATED: Can Inhaling Hot Air From A Sauna Or Hair Dryer Kill Coronavirus?)  The claims that parents of kindergarten through 12th grade students can decide whether or not their child will repeat the current grade level and that all graduating students receive their diplomas if their parents approve of proceeding to the next grade don’t hold up either. “All those claims are false,” Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) External Communications Director Jackie Matthews told the Caller via email. “ISBE has not issued any guidance yet on changes to state-level graduation requirements. Currently, Illinois school districts utilize locally determined criteria in making decisions on students’ grade level placements.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The information in the Facebook post also doesn’t appear to have come from any Illinois CBS affiliates, since none have reported measures to that effect. Nor has the national outlet CBS News published any stories about it. Many school districts across Illinois have already resumed teaching students through internet-based learning programs, according to ABC 7 Chicago.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2627094927569050&set=a.1380332205578668&type=3,https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-10.aspx,https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-05.aspx,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2627094927569050&set=a.1380332205578668&type=3,https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/government/execorders/executive-orders.aspx#y2020,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/22/fact-check-hot-air-sauna-hair-drying-kill-coronavirus/,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-tv-stations-affiliates/,https://abc7chicago.com/coronavirus-covid-19-update-chicago/5999972/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#50242235263f22103431393c2933313c3c35227e333f3d",Has Illinois Governor J.B.

The sale of alcohol has not been banned in Chicago or Cook County as a measure to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Fact Check: The image, which appears to be a screen grab of a story previously shared on Facebook, was posted March 28. But the URL featured in the image redirects people to Prank Mania, a website that allows users to create fake news headlines for jokes.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Yet, while Prank Mania makes it clear that the headline is a joke, some Facebook users failed to pick up on that and shared the screen grab as if it were real news. (RELATED: Can You Get Free Baby Formula During The COVID-19 Pandemic By Calling The Company?) The screen grabbed headline likely draws inspiration from Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect March 21 and is set to expire April 7. That executive order also requires all non-essential businesses in Illinois – including those in Chicago and Cook County – to cease operations in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus. But that does not mean the sale of alcohol in Chicago or Cook County has been suspended starting on April 1. Nowhere in the stay-at-home order does it require establishments selling alcohol to close on that date, nor has Lightfoot issued such a directive through her office. Lightfoot does not have jurisdiction over the entirety of Cook County, further adding to the claim’s dubiousness. The county is governed by Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and 17 commissioners, who have not issued any ban on the sale of alcohol related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  “Establishments” that sell “alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages” are considered essential businesses and are “encouraged to remain open” under Pritzker’s executive order.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, “There are homeless people out there who can’t pay their mortgage.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Also featured in the image is a quote attributed to former Vice President Joe Biden. Verdict: False There is no evidence Ocasio-Cortez ever said the quote attributed to her in the post. It seems to have originated in a 2013 Saturday Night Live sketch. The Daily Caller previously debunked a variation of the quote attributed to Biden. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The March 27 post attributes to the two Democratic politicians seemingly contradictory statements: Ocasio-Cortez is quoted as saying, “There are homeless people out there who can’t pay their mortgage,” while Biden is credited with saying, “People will die, who have never died before.” The Daily Caller didn’t find any evidence that Ocasio-Cortez ever made the statement attributed to her in the Facebook post, however. Searching her social media accounts and ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets didn’t turn up any matches. Nor have any credible media outlets quoted her as saying it. The quote appears to have originated in a 2013 Saturday Night Live sketch – “Weekend Update: Girl You Wish You Hadn’t Started a Conversation with on Christmas” – that features comedians Cecily Strong and Seth Meyers. WATCH:   “You need to wake up and smell the music, Seth,” Strong’s character says at one point. “There are homeless people out there who can’t even pay their mortgages.” (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Say, ‘Truck Drivers Are Destroying America’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The Caller previously debunked a variation of the quote attributed to Biden.

Nor has Buckingham Palace confirmed it. Fact Check: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson became the first major world leader to test positive for the disease on Friday, USA Today reported. Earlier in March, Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, also tested positive. They last came in contact with the queen on March 11 and 12, respectively.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    One post shared on Facebook claims the queen has contracted COVID-19, saying, “Royal Palace confirms Queen Elizabeth tests positive for Coronavirus.” But there is no evidence that its claim is accurate. No statement or confirmation about such a diagnosis could be found on the official British royal family website, and there is likewise no credible news reporting to corroborate it. (RELATED: Did The Vatican Confirm Pope Francis Has The Novel Coronavirus?) “Her Majesty The Queen remains in good health,” a Buckingham Palace spokesperson told Fox News earlier in March after news of Prince Charles’s positive test broke. “The Queen last saw the Prince of Wales briefly after the investiture on the morning of the 12th of March and is following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare.” Speculation that the queen might have contracted the virus intensified after The Sun reported over the weekend that a royal servant in regular contact with the queen also tested positive. But as of now, there is no indication that the queen has tested positive for COVID-19.  The 93-year-old monarch is currently isolating at Windsor Castle with her husband, Prince Philip, as a precaution, according to The Associated Press.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Videos of trains carrying military vehicles in various cities have been circulating on Facebook and Twitter along with claims that the equipment movements signal a national quarantine and martial law are soon to follow. The claims come amid viral rumors of the federal government instituting such measures in response to the country’s coronavirus outbreak. The Facebook page Cannabis Planet, whose video contained Bradley Infantry Vehicles, claimed in a post, “Tanks heading north from San Diego – Quarantine & Martial Law could indeed be next,” while Twitter user @Terrence_STR claimed, “Military equipment being moved into Chicago… Prepare for complete lockdown soon.” Other social media users have made similar claims with images and videos they say were taken in other states, such as New Jersey and Florida. (RELATED: Does This Video Show Military Vehicles Arriving In New York City During The Coronavirus Pandemic?) There are, however, no current plans for a national quarantine and martial law, according to The Associated Press. The National Security Council previously debunked the notion in a March 15 tweet, and President Donald Trump has said he is not currently considering either at this time. (RELATED: Did Trump Donate His Presidential Salary To Rebuild Military Cemeteries?)  “The posted videos show recent Army Materiel Command equipment shipments to military installations including Fort Drum, Fort Bragg and Joint Base Lewis-McChord,” Lt. Colonel Emanuel Ortiz, an Army spokesman, said in an email. “These are normal, pre-coordinated supply-train movements unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.” According to Ortiz, those pre-coordinated shipments include military equipment moving through San Diego, which is near military installations such as Naval Base San Diego, Camp Pendleton and North Island Naval Air Station.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman explained on Twitter that the videos with the Chicago skyline in the background show military equipment being moved from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Fact Check: President Donald Trump signed into law on Friday the $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at helping relieve financial burdens to Americans affected by the coronavirus pandemic. Some social media users alleged that the bill included hidden pay raises for members of Congress.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Guess what else Nancy hid in her stimulus bill?” reads one post. “A pay increase for Congress! But it’s only $25M.” (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Divert $2.4 Billion From Social Security To Pay For Impeachment?) But this is incorrect. While the stimulus package does include $25 million for House “salaries and expenses,” those funds will not go to a “pay increase” for members of Congress. Instead, they go toward “necessary expenses of the House of Representatives to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus,” according to the text of the bill. Evan Hollander, communications director for the House Appropriations Committee, explained further in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation: The $25 million funding is to support the House’s capability to telework, including for the purchase of equipment and improvements to the network. It will also provide for reimbursement costs for the staff of the House Child Care Center and covers the costs of the House food service contracts. In addition, it will support the House Sergeant-At-Arms on continuity of operations matters. The bill signed into law and an earlier GOP-backed proposal included the $25 million appropriation for House “salaries and expenses,” according to The Associated Press.  In accordance with the 1989 Ethics Reform Act, congressional salaries adjustments are automatic and based on changes in private sector wages, unless the adjustment is statutorily denied. Congress has voted against pay increases since 2009, when they first instituted a pay freeze.

Numerous fact-checkers have previously debunked the claim that the U.S. rejected World Health Organization test kits.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The CDC-developed test protocols require that labs use Thermo Fisher Scientific products, including its Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx Real-time PCR instrument, according to CDC testing instructions. Some people, including journalist Amee Vanderpool, expressed concern that Trump would profit from testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Similar sentiments also circulated on social media: “So Trump turned down the WHO testing kits in February,” claimed a March 7 post. “Lo and behold the CDC has ordered kits to be made by a company Trump is a stockholder in – Thermo Fisher Scientific.” (RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A ‘Hoax’ At His South Carolina Rally?) There is, however, no evidence that Trump currently owns Thermo Fisher Scientific stock. He owned between $500,001 and $1 million worth of the company’s stock in 2015 and less than $1,001 worth in 2016, but financial disclosures show he had divested from the company by the time he took office in January 2017. Vanderpool’s article, headlined “Trump Could Profit From Coronavirus Testing,” appears to have first made the claim, citing an outdated 2016 story from The Associated Press. She later updated the story to reflect the fact that Trump’s recent financial disclosures show no evidence he owns stock in the company, but by that time the initial allegation had already spread across the internet.

Verdict: False The sign has been superimposed into the video. It actually shows Biden shopping in November 2012 for children’s books for a reading program started by his wife. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A Facebook user posted a video on March 13 allegedly showing Biden looking at books in the “Brain Exercises for Dementia” section. (RELATED: Did Joe Biden Say ‘People Who Have Never Died Before Are Now Dying From Corona Virus’?) Similar videos have been circulating on other social media platforms: @conservativehypehouse, who posted it on TikTok, said “Yes, this is Joe Biden looking at books about dimentia (sic),” while YouTube user Mavakaga noted he’d been “caught” doing so. But the claim in all of these posts doesn’t hold up. The sign with the words “Brain Exercises for Dementia” had been superimposed into a video of Biden doing holiday shopped at a Costco in November 2012. The original video, which comes from CBS News, has no sign of any kind in the segment where Biden is perusing through children’s books. C-SPAN also covered Biden’s appearance at the grand opening of that Costco. In that video, Biden tells someone who is off-screen that he is “buying a bunch of books for the Book Buddies back in Delaware.” Book Buddies, a program that provides books to low-income children, was started by his wife Jill, according to the Los Angeles Times.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The claim likely stemmed from an article published on a satire website. Fact Check: The claim that Pelosi announced a two-month suspension of Social Security payments starting in April has been circulating on Facebook since at least March 21, with this particular post commenting, “This is bullshit and uncalled for.” (RELATED: Did Congress Deny A $336 Increase In Social Security But Approve An $8,872 Increase In Its Salaries?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is no record of Pelosi announcing such a plan, however. The alleged plan doesn’t appear on her congressional website, nor that of the House speaker. A search of her social media accounts didn’t turn up any announcement of suspending Social Security payments. The claim appears to stem from a March 18 article published on the self-described satire website Potatriots Unite. That article jokingly stated that Pelosi wanted to close the entire Social Security Administration (SSA) for at least two months as a measure to deter the elderly from leaving their homes during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. On March 2020, the Office of the Inspector General of Social Security stated in a press release that the SSA will not suspend or discontinue benefits due to coronavirus-related office closures.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/2U2ALL2018/posts/889773211444017,https://www.facebook.com/2U2ALL2018/posts/889773211444017,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/02/28/fact-check-congress-social-security-salaries/,https://pelosi.house.gov/search/node/%22social%20security%20payments%22%20AND%20%22end%22%20AND%20%22suspend%22,https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/press-releases,https://www.facebook.com/NancyPelosi/,https://www.facebook.com/pelosiforcongress/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22social%20security%22%20AND%20%22end%22%20OR%20%22suspend%22%20(from%3ASpeakerPelosi)&src=typed_query,http://archive.vn/wDvYz,https://archive.vn/e5xOF,http://archive.vn/wDvYz,https://oig.ssa.gov/newsroom/news-releases/march20-advisory,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01757364776e73416560686d7862606d6d64732f626e6c",Did Nancy Pelosi Announce A 2-Month Suspension Of Social Security Starting In April?,,,,,

Fact Check: Many state governments have ordered residents to stay at home in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Ohio, for example, issued a statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect on March 23 and is expected to remain in place until at least April 6, according to CNN.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Some social media users have attributed to Jordan a statement critical of such coronavirus lockdown measures. He made the remark during a March 25 appearance on “Fox and Friends,” it claims. The full alleged quote reads: I’m not too concerned about the Chinese Virus. This is the worst economic crisis we’ve seen in 200 years. We’ve got to end the ridiculous ‘Shelter in Place’ orders. I’ve spoken to many senior citizens and they’re willing to take the risk and go back to work. If a few senior citizens die, I can live with that. Plus we won’t have to pay them their social security ‘handout.’ Jordan never made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post, however. Nor did he make an appearance on Fox News on March 25. (RELATED: Did An MSNBC Reporter Say, ‘I Hope Enough People Die From Coronavirus That It Harms Trump’s Re-Election’?) The statement does not appear on Jordan’s congressional website, and a search of his social media accounts turned up no matches. Videos and transcripts from Fox News show the Ohio congressman didn’t appear on “Fox and Friends” that day.  “Congressman Jordan neither made that Fox appearance nor made that comment,” Ian Fury, communications director for Jordan’s office, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/c4mb2018/photos/a.871427286398889/1403464483195164/?type=3&theater,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/us/coronavirus-which-states-stay-at-home-order-trnd/index.html,https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/us/coronavirus-which-states-stay-at-home-order-trnd/index.html,https://www.facebook.com/c4mb2018/photos/a.871427286398889/1403464483195164/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/c4mb2018/photos/a.871427286398889/1403464483195164/?type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/17/fact-check-msnbc-hope-enough-people-die-coronavirus-harms-trump-reelection/,https://jordan.house.gov/,https://www.facebook.com/repjimjordan/,https://twitter.com/Jim_Jordan,https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/search?q=%22jim%20jordan%22%20AND%20%22fox%20and%20friends%22,https://twitter.com/iantfury?lang=en,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9de9eff8ebf2efddf9fcf4f1e4fefcf1f1f8efb3fef2f0","‘If A Few Senior Citizens Die, I Can Live With That’ – Did Rep.

(RELATED: Can Colloidal Silver ‘Kill’ Coronavirus?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the World Health Organization has debunked this claim on the “Fact or Fiction” section of its website, stating, “There is no scientific evidence that eating hygienically made frozen food and ice-cream spreads the new coronavirus.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also notes on its website that, because of the poor survivability of coronaviruses on surfaces, the risk of spread from food products that have been shipped at refrigerated or frozen temperatures is very low. COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, primarily spreads from person-to-person through respiratory droplets.

Facebook/Screenshot “Kroger announced that everyone who shares this link will be sent a free $55 check to celebrate 101 Anniversary!” reads the link’s headline.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The link in the Facebook post is a scam. Similar hoaxes have been routinely debunked over the years. Fact Check: The post directs social media users to a website that bears the Kroger logo and asks users to answer a series of questions related to customer service. It requires users to answer the questions and share the link on Facebook before they can claim the alleged $55 check from Kroger.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But the link and its promotional offer are actually a scam. The website’s URL doesn’t match that of the official Kroger website, and it does not appear on the supermarket chain’s official Facebook page. Other companies, including Costco, Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks, have been the subject of similar scams. Kroger has previously debunked a promotional scam on Twitter.  @SocialNewsDaily That offer is a scam — we are not affiliated w/ that website. Our Digital Coupons can be found at https://t.co/rvO3m1IXTf. — Kroger Support (@KrogerSupport) October 15, 2014 “That offer is a scam – we are not affiliated w/ that website,” reads part of an October 2014 tweet from Kroger. (RELATED: Hoax Claims That Pepsi Products Are Infected With HIV) The scam website attributes the $55 checks to celebrating Kroger’s 101st anniversary.

Fact Check: President Donald Trump signed into law on Friday a bipartisan $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at helping relieve financial burdens to Americans affected by the coronavirus pandemic.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The bill provides $250 billion for direct payments to individuals and families, including a $1,200 payment to single Americans who make less than $75,000 a year, $2,400 payments to families than make under $150,000 and $500 payments for each qualifying child under the age of 17. One post on Facebook claims U.S. citizens must “go to 2020census.gov and fill out this census form so you can get your stimulus check.” This is incorrect, however. The Census Bureau notes on its website that a person’s answers to the census questions “cannot be used to impact your eligibility for any government benefits, including any potential stimulus package.” Federal law prevents the Census Bureau from using individual responses for anything other than producing statistics, according to the Census Bureau website.

Fact Check: Gates, worth an estimated $99.9 billion, co-founded the software firm Microsoft in 1975. He and his wife Melinda chair the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has pledged to donate up to $100 million to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, according to a statement from the charitable foundation.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A March 23 Facebook post attributes to Gates a long statement about the “spiritual purpose” of the new virus. The statement calls it the “great corrector” and says that the virus is “reminding” people of “how materialistic” society has become. (RELATED: Did Bill Gates Say, ‘Be Nice To Nerds, Chances Are You’ll End Up Working For One’?) “It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it’s the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine) as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to,” the post credits Gates with saying. There is, however, no record of Gates ever writing the statement. The Daily Caller didn’t find any credible online sources attributing it to him, and a search of his verified social media accounts didn’t turn up any similar comments. Nor does it appear on his blog GatesNotes. The statement started circulating on email and messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, on March 23 before migrating to Facebook, according to The Independent. The Sun, a British newspaper, ran an article attributing the statement to Gates but later deleted the story.  “In the heat of events yesterday, The Sun online mistakenly published a spoof story which was doing the rounds on email,” a spokesperson for The Sun told The Independent. “The story has now been removed. Every day The Sun chooses not to publish hundreds of stories and we apologize for this error.” A representative for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation confirmed to Buzzfeed News that Gates did not write the statement.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Biden, who is the frontrunner to win the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has made several notable verbal gaffes in recent months, but this quote does not appear to be among them. (RELATED: Did A Man Die ‘After Taking Malaria Medication Touted By Trump As Possible Cure For Coronavirus’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is no evidence that the former vice president ever actually made the statement. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched his Twitter account, the transcripts of his most recent debates and the transcripts and videos of his other recent public speaking events, and found no record of him saying it. An internet search also failed to turn up any proof. Check Your Fact recently debunked a viral claim that President Donald Trump made a nearly identical statement: “People are dying that have never died before.” Variations of the saying have been in use for decades and have been attributed to former Alabama Gov. George Wallace and author Ernest Hemingway. The Biden campaign did not return a request for comment.

Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Facebook and Twitter users have shared the video of armored military vehicles driving in New York City, claiming it is recent. New York City has become the epicenter of the U.S.’s coronavirus outbreak, with 25,573 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 366 deaths as of Friday morning. The footage, however, actually comes from a video uploaded on YouTube in December 2014 by the YouTube account THEMAJESTIRIUM1. The video’s description reads, “Here you will see a United States Armed Forces mini convoy leaving after participating in the Veterans Day Parade in the Midtown area of Manhattan in New York City.” WATCH:   New York City’s Veterans Day Parade took place on Nov. 11 that year. Joseph Ramos, the New York-based videographer who runs the YouTube account, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that he took the video at that parade in 2014. While the video showing armored military vehicles isn’t recent, soldiers have been deployed to New York City amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Army’s 531st Hospital from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and the 9th Hospital from Fort Hood, Texas, will set up over the weekend to start treating non-coronavirus patients in the city on Monday, according to Stars and Stripes.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

He appears to a fictional character invented to sell an essential oil product. Fact Check: The video tells the story of an alleged Oxford University student who overcame panic attacks and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to become one of the world’s youngest PhD holders. (RELATED: Did An 11-Year-Old ‘Shark Tank’ Contestant Invent A Device To Give The World Free Wi-Fi?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Boston went on to Oxford at 15 majoring in biomolecular biology eventually earning his PhD at the young age of 22,” states text in the video. “He was quickly accepted under renowned Professor Eren Burton’s research team.” Regan, who is said to be 22 or 23 at different points in the video, does not appear to exist, however. A spokesman for Oxford University told the Daily Caller in an email that they did not find anyone in their records matching his description. Burton also appears to be fictional, as the professor’s name isn’t listed in the university’s online directory. The video, which attributes Regan’s success to using an essential oil, seems to be an advertisement for the vetiver oil brand VertiBoost, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. Vetiver oil is made from a type of grass native to India and touted online as a naturopathic treatment for ADHD, though little research has been done on its effectiveness for such a purpose. “There is absolutely no controlled rigorous research on the value of that treatment for ADHD and no rational reason to even do such an experiment at this time,” Dr. Russell Barkley, an ADHD expert, told the Caller via email.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/104909561077478/videos/196568698084658/,https://www.facebook.com/104909561077478/videos/196568698084658/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/01/31/fact-check-boy-invent-device-wireless-internet-free/,https://www.ox.ac.uk/public-affairs/about-pad/news-and-information?wssl=1,https://www.ox.ac.uk/search?wssl=1,https://rossielyn.com/pages/prodigy1?fbclid=IwAR1aneknsDLSttkY88ZDGIEIKGjvy1PixKvBfB6V4XU6hdVdBcDhVXQJsZM,https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/chrysopogon-zizanioides/,http://www.russellbarkley.org/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fb8f899e8d9489bb9f9a929782989a97979e89d5989496",Did This Oxford University Student Become One Of The World’s Youngest PhDs?,,,,,

Fact Check: The video, posted on Facebook on March 18, claims to show a “dolphin in Venice in Covid-19 time,” noting that “without boat movement, the water in the channels is cleaner.” (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Coffins Of Italian Coronavirus Patients?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Italy’s federal government instituted a nationwide lockdown on March 9 that is now set to extend beyond April 3, according to CNBC. Decreased water traffic during the lockdown has visibly improved the water clarity of Venice’s famed canals, BBC News reported. The video, however, doesn’t show a scene in Venice. The footage was actually shot hundreds of miles away in Cagliari, a city on the Italian island of Sardinia. The Italian newswire service ANSA tweeted and published the video on its website, with the translated captions saying, “Mascot dolphin of Luna Rossa in the port of Cagliari.” At press time, Italy has reported 80,589 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 8,215 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/antonio.jose.33046/posts/10217583840886679?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZW4ecc7sv5gKzMsRdpfToddAbt8G_aCYopcm8j_2MK88T0sjyt1xrmNwcw2KqUwfxjnvpBHjUkeVcMhbpQv-ZBWzs9SbY6n0pCRsCTbLr_PiNR2MGkydXcYLB2gRW06VLeEadi5fH5bbrz_x5441rpO&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/24/fact-check-photo-coffins-dead-italian-coronavirus-patients/,https://www.axios.com/italy-coronavirus-timeline-lockdown-deaths-cases-2adb0fc7-6ab5-4b7c-9a55-bc6897494dc6.html,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/italys-death-rate-reaches-record-high-hospitals-in-lombardy-struggle.html,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-51943104/coronavirus-venice-canals-clearer-after-lockdown,https://www.britannica.com/place/Cagliari-Italy,https://twitter.com/Agenzia_Ansa/status/1238852172550418436,https://www.ansa.it/sito/videogallery/sport/2020/03/14/delfino-mascotte-di-luna-rossa-nel-porto-di-cagliari_bef58c55-935d-40b8-aff9-2792ce4d7b21.html,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a5d1d7c0d3cad7e5c1c4ccc9dcc6c4c9c9c0d78bc6cac8",Does This Video Show A Dolphin Swimming In A Venice Canal During The Coronavirus Pandemic?,,,,,

Spokespeople from U.S. formula makers confirmed to the Daily Caller that parents cannot get free formula by calling the customer service line. Fact Check: The claim that makers of baby formula sending cans of free baby formula to parents in need if they call the customer service line has circulated amid consumers stockpiling necessities in anticipation of shortages during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “For parents who cannot find formula in stores for their babies right now grab the can of formula that you do have, and call the number on the back and they will send you a whole case during this time!” reads a March 15 post. The Caller reached out to major U.S. baby formula producers – Gerber, Enfamil and Similac – and was told the claim is false, however. (RELATED: Has The New Coronavirus Been Found In Toilet Paper?) “We are aware of rumors claiming that Gerber is giving away free formula in response to the out of stocks,” Kelly Schneider, a spokesperson from Gerber, told the Caller in an email. “While this is not true, we are committed to our goal of supporting babies and families with dependable, affordable nutrition.” “Currently, Similac is not offering any free product through our customer service line,” said a spokesperson from Abbott Laboratories, the maker of Similac, in a statement to the Caller.  When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Enfamil directed the Caller to a statement published on the infant formula producer’s website. “Contrary to rumors in some online social networks, we are not distributing free cases of formula,” reads the statement. “We are instead focused on ensuring equitable availability for every baby based on what we know and in anticipation of what might develop in the coming weeks”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Similar statements debunking the viral claim as a hoax appear on Gerber and Similac‘s websites. The U.K. formula brand Aptamil also noted on its website that strict regulations in the country prevent the company from sending out free formula products. “Here in the UK, we comply with strict Regulations and we are not allowed to send out formula products to parents for free,” reads a statement on Aptamil’s website. “This is the case for any formula products sold in the UK.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False No vaccine or specific antiviral drug is currently available to prevent or treat the new coronavirus. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The spread of the new coronavirus has coincided with a proliferation of social media posts touting bogus COVID-19 cures and treatments, such as smoking marijuana and ingesting colloidal silver. On March 24, a post claimed U.S. researchers have developed a vaccine against COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus. “Great News! Carona (sic) virus vaccine ready.

Had U.S. researchers developed a vaccine, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. President Donald Trump also has not mentioned anything to that effect in press briefings, nor has he put anything on his Twitter accounts.  The World Health Organization notes on its website that there is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19. “Roche Medical Company” likely references the biotech firm Roche. On March 19, the company did announce that it would be conducting a clinical trial to see if the drug tocilizumab is an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients with pneumonia, but Roche has not made any announcements of a coronavirus vaccine.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The photo of the medical sachets shows COVID-19 testing kits from a South Korean company called Sugentech – not a vaccine, as the post seems to falsely imply.

Fact Check:  Social media has become replete with posts touting fake coronavirus cures ranging from marijuana and cocaine to saunas and colloidal silver. Now, a March 21 Facebook post is claiming hot water with lemon slices can “kill the proliferation of the virus in our bodies.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, as with other bogus remedies circulating online, no proof could be found to support the post’s claim. The World Health Organization (WHO) notes on its website that while some home remedies may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, there is no evidence they can prevent or cure the disease caused by the new virus. In fact, a spokesman for the WHO told The Indian Express that there “is no scientific evidence that lemon/turmeric prevents COVID-19.” (RELATED: Can Colloidal Silver ‘Kill’ Coronavirus?) “There’s no evidence – and it’s even contrary to medical science – that attempting to alkalinize your body through lemon juice or other means does anything for coronavirus,” reads a WebMD post about the topic. “And biologically speaking, it’s simply nonsense.” Variations of the claim about hot lemon water have been previously debunked by other fact-checking websites, including PolitiFact, Snopes and AFP Fact Check.

Though the fish tank solvent has the same active ingredient as the anti-malaria drug chloroquine, they are formulated differently and not the same. Fact Check: Banner Health, an Arizona-based health care company, announced Monday that a husband and wife were hospitalized after consuming a solvent containing chloroquine phosphate that they thought would protect them from the new coronavirus. The husband died shortly after arriving at the hospital.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The story was picked up by numerous media outlets, including The Hill, which originally tweeted its article out with the caption, “Man dies after taking malaria medication touted by Trump as possible cure for coronavirus.” However, the tweet from The Hill was quickly deleted, likely because it was factually inaccurate. The Arizona couple ingested a parasite treatment containing a non-medical form of chloroquine that they had previously used to treat their koi fish. The wife of the deceased man told NBC News that they mixed a small amount of the additive with liquid and drank it after hearing President Donald Trump mention that the anti-malaria drug chloroquine may be effective in combating COVID-19. “I just saw it sitting on the back shelf and said, ‘Hey, isn’t that that stuff they’re talking about on TV?'” his wife recounted, per NBC News. (RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A ‘Hoax’ At His South Carolina Rally?) The fish tank additive that the couple drank is different from the chloroquine medication used to treat malaria in humans. Dr. Daniel Brooks, Banner Poison and Drug Information Center medical director, noted in a statement from Banner Health that while the additive used to fight aquarium parasites has the same active ingredient as the drug chloroquine, it is formulated differently.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn also confirmed on Twitter that the two substances aren’t the same.  The chloroquine phosphate used for treating aquarium fish is not the same as the FDA-approved chloroquine being studied as a possible treatment for #COVID19. Do not take any form of chloroquine unless prescribed to you by a health care provider & obtained from legitimate sources. — Dr. Stephen M. Hahn (@SteveFDA) March 25, 2020    googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “The chloroquine phosphate used for treating aquarium fish is not the same as the FDA-approved chloroquine being studied as a possible treatment for #COVID19,” Hahn tweeted. “Do not take any form of chloroquine unless prescribed to you by a health care provider & obtained from legitimate sources.” The anti-malaria drug is prescription-only and tightly regulated by the FDA, which is currently conducting clinical trials to see if it can combat the disease caused by the new coronavirus. (RELATED: Did Nostradamus Predict The Coronavirus Outbreak?) Trump’s comments were about that anti-malaria medication, not any sort of fish tank solvent. He referred to the medication in a press conference last week as a “common malaria drug” that had shown “encouraging early results” when tested for treating patients with COVID-19. But Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said there is only anecdotal evidence so far that it would be effective.

It comes from a popular 2005 rap song. Fact Check: SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, are vouchers that low income Americans can use to buy food at approved retailers.

The claim originated in a satirical article. Fact Check: Rogers passed away at his home in Sandy Springs, Georgia, on March 2o. A representative, Keith Hagan, told The Associated Press that he died of natural causes. Rogers was 81.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The award-winning singer had an estimated net worth of $250 million, and the post claims that his wife has already revealed what will be done with a significant portion of it. (RELATED: Did Trump Fly US Soldiers Back From Operation Desert Storm On His Airplane?) “Kenny Rogers’ Wife Dominique Tubolls Says Large Portion of $250M Estate, Going To Trump Re-Election!” reads the post. “It’s ‘What He Wanted.'” Rogers has made positive comments about Trump in the past. In a 2015 interview with The Guardian, he said, “I really like him. I think his problem is that he says what everyone wants to hear, but doesn’t say it well. I love what he says, I have to admit.” There is, however, no evidence part of Rogers’ estate will go Trump’s reelection bid. Had his wife done so, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no outlets have reported on it. The family did not mention anything to that effect in its statement to the media, nor has the Trump campaign put out a statement.  Rogers’ wife is named Wanda. The Daily Caller only found Tubolls mentioned online in association with the story featured in the Facebook post. Rumors that she plans to donate some of Rogers’ estate to Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign likely stem from an article published on the satire website Tatersgonnatate.com.

The latest example focuses on the nomenclature of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Hate to break this to all of the morons who call themselves journalists,” claims a March 23 post. “COVID literally stands for ‘Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease’ and the number 19 is due to this being the 19th virus to come out of China.” That is incorrect, however. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on Feb. 11 that COVID-19 stands for “coronavirus disease 2019,” referring to the year the virus was first detected.

The naming guidelines aim to prevent any potential negative affiliation with the disease. The post appears to reference President Donald Trump’s usage of the term “Chinese virus” when referring to the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, a move that some have called racist and xenophobic.

It was fabricated by a satirical Facebook page. Fact Check: The claim that Trump said on Twitter that he would not send coronavirus stimulus checks to Americans who have tweeted “#NotMyPresident” in the last four years has been circulating online since at least March 17.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Yes, I ordered the Treasury Secretary to send checks to Americans!” reads the alleged tweet. “First however, we will go through your social media history from the last 4 years and search for any post with #NotMyPresident in it. I wouldn’t think of offending you with a check if I’m not your president! #MAGA.” There is, however, no evidence that Trump ever tweeted the statement. The tweet appears nowhere on his Twitter timelines, and ProPublica’s archive has no record of him deleting it. (RELATED: No This Viral Image Doesn’t Show Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear’s Tweet About School Closures) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the fabricated tweet was made by the Facebook page Real Fake Tweets, which disclaims in its cover photo that its content is satirical. The page’s “About” section says, “My goal is to make a fake tweet so realistic, it gets investigated by Snopes.” The fake tweet appears to draw inspiration from the economic stimulus package aimed at helping relieve financial burdens to Americans amid the global coronavirus pandemic. That stimulus package includes sending $1,200 checks directly to Americans making less than $75,000.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: In mid-February, conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh drew wide criticism for saying the country won’t elect “a gay guy kissing his husband on the debate stage” president. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had run as one of the first openly gay men seeking a major party’s nomination before suspending his campaign on March 1, according to The New York Times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The post uses a photo that allegedly shows Buttigieg kissing his husband on the debate stage to make a remark in the same vein as Limbaugh’s. “What about this? A picture of Mayor Pete kissing his husband on the debate stage, which he does frequently,” reads part of the post. “That’s what causes a problem for me.” There have been 12 Democratic presidential primary debates, and Buttigieg participated in 10 of them, according to the Washington Post. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Soldiers ‘Crying And Visibly Shaken’ Over Trump’s Syrian Withdrawal?) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the photo does not come from any of the 10 debates where Buttigieg was present. The image, taken by Scott Olson of Getty Images on April 14, 2019, captures a moment between Buttigieg and his husband at the rally when he announced his presidential candidacy, according to its caption.

Fact Check: The March 20 post claims the island nation “has not recorded any @corona virus case.” A photo of a marijuana plant accompanies the claim, seemingly implying that marijuana was a contributing factor. (RELATED: Viral Post Claims Mexico Doesn’t Have Any Coronavirus Cases)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Jamaica has, contrary to the post’s claim, reported at least 25 confirmed cases of COVID-19 to date, according to the Jamaican Ministry of Health and Wellness. On March 20, it had 16 confirmed cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus, per the World Health Organization’s (WHO) situation report. Jamaica’s first COVID-19 case was confirmed on March 10. To limit the spread of the new coronavirus, the country has implemented travel restrictions on travelers from China, Iran, South Korea, Italy, Singapore, Germany, Spain, France and the U.K., per the Jamaica Information Service. Travelers from countries with local transmission are required to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, USA Today reported. The Daily Caller has previously debunked the claim that marijuana “kills” the new coronavirus. Smoking and taking supplements aren’t effective against COVID-19 and can even be harmful, per the WHO website. At press time, the new coronavirus has spread to 172 countries and regions, sickening some 458,927 people globally, according to the Johns Hopkins University interactive map. COVID-19, which has killed some 20,807 people worldwide, was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on March 11.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The video was deceptively edited to remove the context around Biden’s comment. He was actually calling for Democrats to show unity and stop attacking each other on the campaign trail. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Biden made a campaign stop in Kansas City, Missouri, on March 7, after which his presidential campaign posted a video of the full speech on his verified YouTube channel. WATCH:  Multiple Facebook users shared a short clip from Biden’s speech, with the headlines and captions suggesting that he endorsed Trump for president. Dan Scavino, the White House director of social media, and Charlie Kirk, the Turning Point USA founder, also shared versions of the clip on Twitter, where Trump retweeted them.  “Turn this primary from a campaign that’s about negative attacks into one about what we’re for, because we cannot get reelect – we cannot win this reelection,” Biden says in the clip. “Excuse me, we can only reelect Donald Trump.” The Daily Caller reviewed the entirety of Biden’s speech and found that the viral clip has been deceptively edited to make it appear like the former vice president is endorsing his political rival. Biden did stumble over his words as he spoke, but the clip leaves out the important context that Biden was actually calling for Democrats to show unity and stop attacking each other.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “If you want a nominee who will bring this party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign and turn this primary from a campaign that’s about negative attacks into one about what we are for, because we cannot get reelect – we cannot win this reelection,” Biden said. “Excuse me, we can only reelect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It’s got to be a positive campaign, so join us.” Biden made the same point while speaking earlier in the day as well. (RELATED: Video Claims To Show Bernie Sanders Making Racist Remarks In Front Of Schoolchildren) Twitter labeled versions of the edited clip as “manipulated media” under its new policy addressing fake or misleading content on the platform.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Screen grabs of text messages warning that the federal government plans to institute a national quarantine and martial law have been circulating on social media since at least March 15. (RELATED: Did Costco Recall Kirkland Toilet Paper Due To Coronavirus Contamination?) This particular post attributes the warning to a boyfriend’s dad working in the military and a friend’s sister-in-law working at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Others posts credit “military friends,” the “DC mayor” or “a physician at the Clev. Clinic” with similar warnings, according to FactCheck.org.

COMPLETELY FALSE We will continue to see closings & restrictions on hours of non-essential businesses in certain cities & states.

COMPLETELY FALSE,” Rubio tweeted. “We will continue to see closings & restrictions on hours of non-essential businesses in certain cities & states. But that is NOT marshall law.” Martial law is defined as “the replacement of civil rule with temporary military authority in a time of crisis,” according to the Military Times. But there is no evidence the federal government plans to enact such a measure for 30 days, and President Donald Trump has said he is not considering it at this time. The claim of martial law seems to stem from Trump invoking the Stafford Act when he declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency on March 13. However, that federal disaster relief law actually empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assist state and local governments in dealing with the outbreak and coordinate the country’s response.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The hoax has circulated in other countries. Fact Check: The image, posted March 23, shows an alert message from the Neighbors app warning users about the U.S. military’s supposed effort to limit the spread of the new coronavirus with pesticides. A map visible in the image suggests that users in San Diego received the alert.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “So you must stay indoors after twelve o’clock at night and remove all clothes which are outside,” instructs the alert. “When you hear the sounds of airplanes at night, it is for you to know that it is related to this matter (COVID-19).” President Donald Trump outlined on March 22 the federal government’s plan to fund the National Guard’s efforts to combat the new virus in New York, California and Washington, three of the states hit hardest by the new coronavirus. There is no evidence that the U.S. military is spraying coronavirus-killing pesticides from helicopters, however. The Daily Caller didn’t find any credible reports of an operation like this taking place on March 23 or any other date. A spokesman for the Pentagon confirmed that the military has no such plans. Similar messages have been debunked by fact-checkers in India and Pakistan, among other countries.

Helicopters have been used for aerial pesticide spraying in the past, but that was for controlling the populations of insects that carry diseases, not the diseases themselves.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=225608068818198&set=a.118523006193372&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=225608068818198&set=a.118523006193372&type=3&theater,https://www.cnet.com/news/how-rings-neighbors-app-is-making-home-security-a-social-thing/,https://www.c-span.org/video/?470588-1/white-house-coronavirus-task-force-briefing&start=3997,https://www.google.com/search?q=pesticides+air+coronavirus&oq=pesticide&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l3j69i57j69i59j69i61j69i60l2.2951j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.altnews.in/no-medicine-will-be-sprayed-in-the-air-to-kill-coronavirus-fake-message-viral/,https://tribune.com.pk/story/2179663/1-fact-check-viral-message-army-choppers-spraying-anti-corona-pesticides/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/17/fact-check-msnbc-hope-enough-people-die-coronavirus-harms-trump-reelection/,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2012-06-15-fl-mosquito-spraying-palm-20120610-story.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#473335223128350723262e2b3e24262b2b22356924282a",Are Military Helicopters Spraying Pesticides Around The Country To Combat Coronavirus?,,,,,

The pandemic was heavily covered by major media outlets. Fact Check: The viral post attempts to make a comparison between the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, saying, “I’m confused… during the Swine Flu, 18,000 Americans lost their lives and the press said nothing. What’s different this time?”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Swine flu, also called pandemic H1N1, swept through the U.S. in 2009, sickening roughly 61 million Americans. The CDC estimates that the virus killed 12,469 people in the U.S. – not 18,000, as the post claims. Between 151,700 and 575,400 people died from swine flu worldwide, a 2012 study estimated. (RELATED: Can Colloidal Silver ‘Kill’ Coronavirus?) The post’s claim that the media didn’t cover the swine flu pandemic doesn’t hold up either. Major broadcast networks covered it extensively, as did digital and print publications. For the week of April 27 to May 3, 2009, swine flu “accounted for almost a third of mainstream media coverage,” according to Pew Research Center. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic came roughly 11 years before the current COVID-19 pandemic that has, as of March 25, killed more than 19,600 people.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The Brazilian president – not Conte – is pictured in the post. Fact Check: At press time, Italy has reported over 69,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 6,820 deaths, surpassing China as the country with the highest death toll, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map. The New York Times and others have labeled the country as the new epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic. “We have lost control, we have killed the epidemic physically and mentally,” a viral March 22 post credits Conte with saying. “Can’t understand what more we can do, all solutions are exhausted on ground. Our only hope remains up in the Sky, God rescue your people.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But there is no evidence that Conte ever actually said these words. No credible source could be found to corroborate the quote, and it appears nowhere on his social media accounts. Its message seemingly contradicts the tone of statements Conte has previously made about the pandemic.  159 anni fa veniva proclamata l’Unità d’Italia. Da allora il nostro Paese ha affrontato mille difficoltà, guerre mondiali, il regime fascista. Ma gli italiani, con orgoglio e determinazione, hanno sempre saputo rialzarsi e ripartire. A testa alta. — Giuseppe Conte (@GiuseppeConteIT) March 17, 2020  “159 years ago the unification of Italy was proclaimed. Since then, our country has faced a thousand difficulties, world wars, the fascist regime,” reads a translated tweet from Conte. “But the Italians, with pride and determination, have always been able to get up and start again. With your head held high.” The photo, taken by Sergio Lima for the news website Poder360, actually shows Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro during an emotional speech at a worship service in December 2019. He teared up when recalling his experience getting stabbed and almost killed in a September 2019 attack, according to a translation of the Poder360 article.

Florida Department of Military Affairs and Georgia National Guard spokespeople said National Guard troops have not blocked access between the states. Fact Check: The viral post claims, without offering a source or evidence, that the National Guard is blocking access from Florida to Georgia. It has been shared more than 5,800 times on Facebook at press time.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    If the National Guard in either state had started restricting travel between Georgia and Florida, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported it. Nor have the National Guard Bureau, Georgia National Guard or Florida National Guard issued press releases announcing the measure. “I can confirm that the Florida National Guard has not set up border checkpoints or anything of the like,” said William M.G. Manley, deputy communications director for the Florida Department of Military Affairs, in an email to the Daily Caller. Georgia National Guard spokesman Lt. Colonel Patrick Watson also confirmed in a phone interview with the Caller that the post’s claim is “absolutely not true.” (RELATED: Did Nostradamus Predict The Coronavirus Outbreak?) More than 1,100 Florida National Guard members have been activated to support the state’s response to the new coronavirus, according to Manley. They are working with state health and emergency management staff at community-based COVID-19 testing sites and supporting airport screening operations, among other duties.  On March 14, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp called up to 2,000 members of the state’s National Guard to “assist with COVID-19 mitigation and critical services, including the transfer of Georgians currently at Dobbins Air Reserve Base to their homes,” according to CBS 46.

The photo, however, actually shows the caskets of African migrants killed in a 2013 shipwreck off the coast of the Italian island of Lampedusa. 111 coffins were later displayed inside a nearby airport hangar where survivors paid their respects, according to USA Today. It is there that a photographer for the Italian news agency Ansa took the picture.

Ted Yoho said that black Americans should only get three-fifths of a vote.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence Yoho made the comment. The claim actually comes from a satirical article published in 2014. Fact Check: The viral post credits Yoho with saying black Americans should only get three-fifths of a vote. The alleged comment appears to reference the 1787 Three-Fifths Compromise that counted slaves as three-fifths of a person when apportioning taxes and state representation in Congress.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “He is an elected member of Congress and he actually said that… OUT LOUD!” says the post. “You stay classy Florida.” (RELATED: Was Obama ‘Furious’ After Being Photographed Carrying ‘The Post-American World’?) There is, however, no evidence the Florida congressman actually made this statement. The Daily Caller conducted an internet search and did not find any credible results for the remark, except for instances where it was being debunked by other fact-checking websites. The fake quote has been circulating online since at least 2014, when the website Newslo published an article quoting Yoho as saying, “And a black man’s vote counts as 3/5 of a white man’s.” The “Show Facts” button that allows readers to see which parts are true in the article indicates that the statement has indeed been fabricated. That satirical story appears to have drawn inspiration for its fake quote from a video showing Yoho saying at a 2012 campaign stop, “I’ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote.” But Yoho didn’t mention black voters during the event, according to PolitiFact.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Breaking News: Russia unleashed more than 500 lions on its streets to ensure that people are staying indoors during this pandemic outbreak,” claims the chyron in the alleged news broadcast. A ticker below that also claims, “Vladmir (sic) Putin released around 500 lions to make people stay indoors.” The supposed screen grab of a breaking news broadcast appears to have been fabricated. In fact, one version of the post included a watermark for Break Your Own News, a website that allows users to create their own news chyrons. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Russian River Frozen Like The ‘Scream’ Mask) Found on the Caters News Agency website, the photo actually shows a male lion named Columbus prowling the streets of Johannesburg, South Africa, during the production of a film in 2016. Columbus has starred in a number of movies and TV commercials, according to Metro.co.uk. Like many other countries, Russia has taken steps to curb the spread of the coronavirus, including shutting down its border with China. Dr. Melita Vujnovic, the World Health Organization’s representative in Russia, told CNN that the country has also been testing for cases and tracing contacts, among other measures.  At the time of publication, Russia has reported 495 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and one death, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is currently no evidence of COVID-19 transmission associated with food. The image appears to have been created on a news generator app. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Screen grabs of alleged news broadcasts reporting that the new coronavirus has been found on various foods and products have circulated widely over the past month. This particular post, which has been shared more than 1,200 times, makes a similar claim about crab legs. “Corona virus has been found in crab legs,” reads the chyron. Below that, a ticker states, “The virus has now been found in crab lega (sic) studies say.” Both the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have stated that there currently isn’t any evidence of COVID-19 transmission associated with food, however. No scientific studies saying that crab legs carry the new coronavirus could be found either. COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, primarily spreads from person-to-person through respiratory droplets, according to the CDC.

It is not found in any of his written works. Fact Check: The internet is replete with claims that Nostradamus has predicted various significant world events that occurred after his death in 1566. This particular post credits him with foretelling the outbreak of the new coronavirus that has sickened hundreds of thousands of people worldwide.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “There will be a twin year (2020) from which will arise a queen (Corona) who will come from the east (China) and who will spread a plague (virus) in the darkness of night on a country with 7 hills (Italy) and will transform the Twilight of men into dust (death), to destroy and ruin the world,” reads the alleged prophecy Nostradamus made in 1551. “It will be the end of the world economy as you know it.” But there’s no evidence that Nostradamus ever actually wrote this prophecy. It does not appear in his 1555 book “Les Prophéties” or any of his other collected works. An internet search failed to return any results prior to 2020, indicating that the quote is likely a modern creation. As the post alludes to, the coronavirus outbreak originated in China and has since spread to countries around the world, including Italy, which has become one of the hardest hit nations, per World Health Organization data. The global economy has also taken a massive hit amid countries urging people not to gather in public spaces and instituting shutdowns, among other measures, to help curb the pandemic’s spread. Nostradamus fans have previously credited the 16th-century astrologer with predicting the Great Fire of London in 1666 and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in his 1555 book of prophecies.

Fact Check:  Twitter and Facebook are replete with posts saying Trump made the statement that “people are dying that have never died before” in response to deaths from the new coronavirus. But interestingly enough, none of the posts include a source to corroborate the claim.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This seems to be because there is no record of Trump ever making the statement. Several posts on social media specified that the statement allegedly came Tuesday, March 17, a day Trump held two events that were recorded and broadcasted: a White House task force briefing on the coronavirus outbreak and a meeting with tourism executives about the global pandemic’s impact on the industry. The alleged statement was not found in the transcript of either event. There is also no record of him tweeting it on his Twitter timeline or in ProPublica’s archive of his deleted tweets. Other fact-checkers failed to find any evidence that Trump made the statement, and Snopes noted the saying is a “long-standing internet joke.” (RELATED: Can Inhaling Hot Air From A Sauna Or Hair Dryer Kill Coronavirus?)

Facebook/Screenshot “I will not stop searching and posting information to help my follow [sic] Citizens who love our Country and our freedom,” reads part of the accompanying caption.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  Soros does not own Smartmatic and is only loosely connected to the company through its chairman. Samira Saba, communications director for the company, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the firm’s only U.S. client is Los Angeles County. Fact Check: The viral image alludes to a years-old conspiracy theory that Soros, a philanthropist and Democratic megadonor, influences American elections through his involvement in Smartmatic, a firm that specializes in building and implementing electronic voting systems. Smartmatic has operated in 25 countries, including the U.S., where the firm has provided election equipment and technical support in some areas since 2005, according to its website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, Soros does not and has never had any ownership stake in the voting technology firm, according to a statement on the company’s website. The only connection between Soros and Smartmatic is its chairman, Lord Mark Malloch-Brown. He has worked with Soros in the past and sits on the global board of Soros’s Open Society Foundations, an organization that funds “building inclusive and vibrant democracies.” Smartmatic emphasizes on its website that it is “100% privately owned” and has “no ties to political parties or groups in any country.” (RELATED: Was Kavanaugh Accuser Deborah Ramirez A Soros Fellow?) During the 2005 and 2006 election cycles, the firm sold around 60,000 U.S.-certified electronic voting devices that were used in 15 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. Its voting machines were also used in D.C. during that time period. Smartmatic operates one voting system in Los Angeles County that was recently used in the state’s March 3 presidential primary. Saba confirmed to the DCNF that Los Angeles County is their only U.S. client.  This isn’t the first time the billionaire philanthropist has been the subject of an online conspiracy theory. One such theory claims he was a Nazi officer during World War II, while another claims that he organized and funded the 2018 migrant caravan that attempted to enter the U.S. Both have been thoroughly disproven.

It can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates. Fact Check: YouTube and Facebook users have been sharing the video that claims blowing hot air into your sinuses will help eliminate the new coronavirus because heat kills it. Someone named Dr. Dan Lee Dimke, who appears to have a doctorate in education, narrates the video.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But, according to medical doctors, the information in the video is inaccurate and could even be dangerous to one’s health. (RELATED: Does ‘Harry Potter’ Actor Daniel Radcliffe Have The Novel Coronavirus?) “They have no data to support that,” Dr. Katrina Armstrong, physician-in-chief at Massachusetts General Hospital, said about the video’s claims in an interview with MassLive.com. “We have not done randomized, controlled trials of sauna use, but there’s not a reasonable scientist who would suggest that.” Faheem Younas, an infection disease expert at the University of Maryland, debunked the notion of using a hair dryer to kill the virus, tweeting, “Please don’t. Our nose carries bacteria, as part of normal flora. Those bacteria may get confused.” “Most of the body is the same temperature, and there’s no evidence to suggest it’s preferentially attacking the sinuses,” Armstrong also noted.  The video’s claim that heat kills the COVID-19 virus doesn’t hold up either. In fact, the World Health Organization notes on its “Myth Buster” page that the virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates. At the time of publication, there are 335,991 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map.

Fact Check:  The Daily Caller watched the entirety of the English-dubbed version and found that, contrary to the post’s claim, the 1988 animated film does not depict a disease outbreak or mention the WHO at any point. The “apocalyptic event” referenced in the post is actually an explosion that destroys Tokyo at the beginning of the film.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    An early scene does show a large sign counting down the days to the Tokyo Olympics, with graffiti below it saying, “Just cancel it,” according to Mashable Southeast Asia. However, the Olympics are only referenced visually a few times and aren’t central to the plot of the film, though the final battle takes place inside the Olympic stadium. “Akira” is set in 2019 in Neo Tokyo, a fictional city built where Tokyo was previously located. Its main plot revolves around a teen biker gang that gets entangled in a secret government project involving children with supernatural powers. At the time of publication, the WHO has not advised Japan to cancel the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but rather provided them with guidance. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Wuhan Lab With The Same Logo As The Fictional ‘Resident Evil’ Lab) The International Olympics Committee (IOC) announced on March 22 that it will take four weeks to consider its options for dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. Options include modifying existing operational plans to allow the Games to begin on July 24 and changing the start date entirely, according to the IOC’s statement.  COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has spread across the global, sickening some 335,972 people and killing some 14,632 others, according to the Johns Hopkins University live map.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Ethylene glycol is not found in over-the-counter hand sanitizers. It is safe to use hand sanitizers around pets. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Hand sanitizer has been flying off the shelves as consumers seek methods to protect themselves from the new coronavirus. The image, posted March 18, warns pet owners about hand sanitizer allegedly containing a toxic compound found in antifreeze. “Please DO NOT pet your dog or any other pet after using hand sanitizer,” reads the post. “It contains ethanol glycol that’s also found in anti-freeze that’s toxic to them!! They might lick the area you’ve touched them.” The three most common active ingredients in hand sanitizers are ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol and benzalkonium chloride. Approximately 97 percent of over-the-counter hand sanitizers use one of those three ingredients, per the Food and Drug Administration. Ethyl alcohol, the most common of the three active ingredients, is the same ethanol found in beer and wine, according to USA Today. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Swiffer WetJet Cleaning Solution Is Poisonous For Pets)  The post appears to confuse that common hand sanitizer base with ethylene glycol, the antifreeze ingredient that is toxic to both humans and animals. Ethylene glycol has a sweet taste that makes ingesting it attractive to pets, according to the VCA Hospitals website. It is not used in hand sanitizer. Savee Dalgo, a spokesperson for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), told the Daily Caller that it is safe for pet owners to use hand sanitizer. The Pet Poison Hotline does note, however, that an animal that ingests large amounts of hand sanitizer may experience lethargy, vomiting and weak respiration, among other issues.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “When using hand sanitizers, refrain from petting your dog or cat until your hands are completely dry,” Dr. Tina Wismer, senior director of the ASPCA’s Animal Poison Control Center, advised in a statement to the Caller. “Once it has evaporated it is safe to touch your pets.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Gates’ father was a lawyer, not a woodcutter. Fact Check: The viral post attempts to paint Gates, worth an estimated $96.3 billion, as ungenerous by recounting an alleged incident in which he only tipped a waiter $5 after dining at a restaurant. One of his daughters, the post claims, had previously tipped $500.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “She is the daughter of the world’s richest man, but I am the son of a wood cutter,” Gates supposedly said to justify his tip. (RELATED: Did Bill Gates Say, ‘I Choose A Lazy Person To Do A Hard Job’?) There is, however, no evidence the alleged incident ever actually took place. The post does not offer a source or give details about where it supposedly happened, and the Daily Caller found no credible reports of Gates giving a $5 tip to a waiter. Gates grew up in an upper-middle class family. His father is a retired Washington attorney, and his late mother worked as a teacher and served on several corporate boards, according to the biography on Gate’s blog. He and his wife Melinda chair the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the world’s largest charitable organization, and have pledged to donate at least half of their vast wealth to philanthropic causes, according to Forbes. To date, they have donated at least $35.8 billion worth of Microsoft stock, making the post’s claim of him being ungenerous even more dubious.  Variations of the story have been circulating online since at least 2012, according to Snopes.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.instagram.com/p/B9TtvVunJt7/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9TtvVunJt7/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading,https://www.instagram.com/factloverz_/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9TtvVunJt7/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/#14bfa77e689f,https://www.instagram.com/p/B9TtvVunJt7/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/24/fact-check-bill-gates-microsoft-lazy-person-hard-job-easy-way/,https://www.biography.com/business-figure/bill-gates,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/who-we-are/general-information/leadership/executive-leadership-team/william-h-gates-sr,https://www.biography.com/business-figure/bill-gates,https://www.gatesnotes.com/Bio,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/History,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/31/14-billionaires-signed-bill-gates-and-warren-buffetts-giving-pledge.html,https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/#555a96ba689f,https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/#555a96ba689f,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/son-of-a-woodcutter/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8cf8fee9fae3fecce8ede5e0f5efede0e0e9fea2efe3e1",Did Bill Gates Give A Waiter A $5 Tip Because He’s The ‘Son Of A Wood Cutter’?,,,,,

Verdict: False The letter is fabricated. Alcohol does not reduce one’s risk of getting the new coronavirus. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Posts about supposed prevention methods have circulated widely on social media as the number of global coronavirus cases continues to rise. This particular post credits a Missouri hospital with saying alcohol consumption can reduce the risk of getting COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “After extensive research, our findings show that consuming alcoholic beverages may help reduce the risk of infection by the novel coronavirus: COVID-19,” reads the letter. “Tequila is the most recommended for drinking, cleaning and sanitizing.” There is, however, no record of Saint Luke’s Hospital issuing a press release or sending correspondence to this effect. A spokeswoman for the Missouri-based hospital system told the Daily Caller that the letter is fake. “The information circulating is definitely a fake letter,” Lindsey Stich said in an email. “Vodka and tequila have no impact on the coronavirus.” (RELATED: Do Blood Donors Automatically Get Tested For Coronavirus?)  Indeed, a World Health Organization (WHO) infographic explicitly states that drinking alcohol does not prevent or protect people from the new coronavirus. At least 44 Iranians died from alcohol poisoning after consuming bootleg alcohol in an effort to treat the virus, according to USA Today. The hospital also addressed the contents of the letter on Facebook, saying that they follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines when it comes to mitigating transmission of COVID-19.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   The CDC recommends frequent hand-washing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth and social distancing, among other measures. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine available for the virus, according to the WHO. A previous iteration of the letter recommended vodka for consumption and making hand sanitizer, according to Agence France-Presse.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False There is no evidence Biden leaked the identities of SEAL Team 6. News outlets had already identified the unit by the time Biden first mentioned their role in the operation. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The death of bin Laden was announced by then-President Barack Obama on May 1, 2011, after a raid carried out by SEAL Team 6 on the al-Qaeda leader’s Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound resulted in his death. The elite Navy SEAL unit often conducts classified missions that make anonymity necessary to protect themselves and loved ones from enemy retaliation. On May 3, 2011, Biden praised the SEALs for their work in a speech at an event for the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank. (RELATED: Did Trump Reveal A ‘Covert’ SEAL Team?) “Folks, I’d be remiss also if I didn’t say an extra word about the incredible events, extraordinary events this past Sunday,” Biden said. “As vice president of the United States, as an American, I was in absolute awe — awe of the capacity and dedication of the entire team, both the intelligence community, the CIA, the SEALs. It was just extraordinary.” That speech appeared to be the first time the Obama administration publicly acknowledged the involvement of Navy SEALs in the operation. Biden did not mention the unit or team members by name, however. (RELATED: Was Trump Golfing During The al-Baghdadi Raid?)  Some commentators and social media users nevertheless blamed Biden for leaking the identities of the SEAL Team 6 after 15 members of the unit were killed in August 2011 by a Taliban insurgent who downed their helicopter in Afghanistan with a rocket-propelled grenade. The claim resurfaced shortly after Biden announced his 2020 presidential candidacy, despite no evidence to support the claim. “I did not believe that night in May 2011 — or today — that Vice President Biden’s comments were in any way inappropriate or that they put at risk the lives of those who conducted that historic operation,” retired Navy Admiral James Stavridis told Snopes in an email. “I think he kept it at a level of generalization that made it completely acceptable in my view.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Multiple news outlets, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Associated Press, had identified the Navy SEALs as those involved in the raid prior to Biden’s speech. An investigation into the deadly August 2011 crash did not find that the helicopter was targeted as part of a premeditated attack. We rate this claim false.

Illinois station broadcasts the pre-rigged election results day before the election (Biden 50% Bernie 45%) #ElectionFraudhttps://t.co/2DKnr9HpMf — Bethany James Winn ???????? (@bethanyjameswin) March 16, 2020   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Similar claims also appeared on Facebook.  Verdict: False The news station accidentally aired a graphic containing test numbers during its rehearsal the day before the primary took place. The numbers do not reflect the primary’s actual vote totals.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Fact Check: Illinois held its Democratic presidential primary on March 17, amid multiple states postponing their own primaries over concerns about the new coronavirus. (RELATED: Did Bernie Sanders Tweet, ‘My Object In Life Is To Dethrone God And Destroy Capitalism’?) On March 16, the day before the state’s primary, a short clip from a local broadcast news station aired during “The Price is Right.” That clip, which came from WCIA-TV, included a graphic showing former Vice President Joe Biden beating out Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, with the candidates winning 50 and 45 percent of votes respectively. People quickly reacted to the graphic on social media: @bethanyjameswin, who tweeted a Facebook video, called it “#ElectionFraud,” while a Facebook user remarked, “In other news, the Illinois primary is tomorrow and they decided to post election results a FULL DAY EARLY … #VoterSuppression.”  The local station, WCIA-TV, did not broadcast “pre-rigged election results,” as social media users claimed. What viewers saw on their televisions was actually a mock-up graphic that the station accidentally broadcasted during their rehearsals for the next day’s Democratic primary coverage. Broadcast news stations often do run-throughs to test graphics and technology. WCIA-TV explained in a statement that the graphic only aired for about a minute and its vote totals “are only test numbers and were zeroed out following the rehearsal.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  In actuality, Biden won roughly 59 percent of the vote, while Sanders won about 36 percent, according to CNN. “This was an error, and in no way reflects the results of Tuesday night’s Illinois Primary Election,” the station’s statement concluded. “Management apologizes for any confusion or inconvenience.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://twitter.com/bethanyjameswin/status/1239616682479542273,https://twitter.com/hashtag/ElectionFraud?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://t.co/2DKnr9HpMf,https://twitter.com/bethanyjameswin/status/1239616682479542273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101758553262223&set=a.662003847083&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/nogafaithh/posts/10219719608611959,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-primary-elections/illinois-results?icid=election_nav,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/16/politics/state-primaries-postponed-coronavirus/index.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/12/22/fact-check-bernie-sanders-tweet-object-dethrone-god-capitalism/,https://www.priceisright.com/,https://twitter.com/bethanyjameswin/status/1239616682479542273,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101758553262223&set=a.662003847083&type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/bethanyjameswin/status/1239616682479542273,https://www.wcia.com/news/election-rehearsal-airs-in-error/,https://www.wcia.com/news/election-rehearsal-airs-in-error/,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/politics/illinois-primary-results-live/index.html,https://www.wcia.com/news/election-rehearsal-airs-in-error/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#790d0b1c0f160b391d181015001a1815151c0b571a1614",Did An Illinois News Station Air ‘Pre-Rigged Election Results’ The Day Before The Primary?,,,,,

Spokespeople from his hotels have denied that the hotels will become coronavirus hospitals. Fact Check: The Juventus forward co-owns the Pestana CR7 Hotels with the Pestana Hotel Group, according to The Independent. The brand currently operates in Lisbon and Funchal, two cities in Ronaldo’s home country of Portugal. (RELATED: Did Utah Jazz Player Emmanuel Mudiay Test Positive For Coronavirus?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “BREAKING NEWS: Cristiano Ronaldo is turning his chain of hotels in Portugal into hospitals to treat those with underlying health conditions who have coronavirus,” claims a March 15 Facebook post. “Their treatment will be FREE as Cristiano Ronaldo will be paying for everything, including salaries of doctors and nurses.” However, the Daily Caller didn’t find any credible media reports of Ronaldo announcing the move, only outlets debunking the claim. There is no mention of such hotel conversions on his verified social media accounts. “The information is inaccurate,” a Pestana Hotel spokesperson told Agence France-Presse. “We did not receive any indication of this regard.” The hotel’s Lisbon branch also told Dutch outlet RTL Nieuws on March 15 that they have no plans to convert into a hospital for coronavirus patients.  Ronaldo does not appear to have spoken much about the new coronavirus that has sickened over 254,000 people worldwide. He has only tweeted once about the virus, urging people to follow the recommendations of public health officials.  For information: https://t.co/rbDpMTcs6s pic.twitter.com/jWzDZX0GJK — Cristiano Ronaldo (@Cristiano) March 13, 2020   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “It is important we all follow the advice of the WHO (World Health Organization) and the governing bodies on how we handle this current situation,” he tweeted. “Protecting human life must come above any other interests.” Ronaldo and other Juventus players are currently self-quarantining because one of their teammates, Daniele Rugani, tested positive for the new coronavirus, according to a statement from the Italian soccer club. Some 1,020 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, have been documented in Portugal at the time of publication. The claim appears to have originated with Spanish sportscaster Adriano Del Monte, who tweeted on March 14 that Ronaldo was converting his hotels into hospitals. He has since deleted the tweet.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Kamala Harris is the aunt of former “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett. Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker were in contact with Smollett shortly before his alleged attack, it also claims.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The Daily Caller didn’t find any familial connection between Smollett and Harris. There is no evidence Smollett was in contact with either senator before the alleged incident. Fact Check: Smollett, who is black and gay, was indicted for a second time in February on charges of filing a false police report that he was attacked by two men who beat him up and shouted racist, homophobic slurs. He previously faced similar charges but saw them dropped by Chicago prosecutors in early 2019.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post offers a conspiracy theory that Harris, who originally called the alleged attack an “attempted modern day lynching” but later said she was “sad, frustrated, and disappointed” by developments in the case, is Smollett’s aunt. It also creates a dubious link between the actor and Booker, who initially offered support to Smollett, claiming Booker and Harris were in contact with him just before the alleged attack. There is, however, no evidence that Harris and Smollett are related in any way. (RELATED: Is Chelsea Clinton Married To The Nephew Of George Soros?) The surname of Smollett’s mother was Harris before marriage, according to California birth records, but her first name, Janet, doesn’t match that of Harris’ only sibling. Maya is the name of Harris’ sister, according to their mother’s obituary. No connection between Smollett and Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, could be found. “We have no information on Mr. Smollett being related to Senator Harris,” Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told FactCheck.org.  The post’s claim that Smollett was in contact with Harris and Booker shortly before the alleged attack on the actor doesn’t hold up either. If they had been in Smollett’s phone records, major media outlets would have picked it up, yet no news organizations have reported about it.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The tweet about blood banks testing people for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus, garnered more than 250,000 likes before it was deleted. Nevertheless, screen grabs of it continue to circulate widely on other social media platforms.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “CORONAVIRUS LOOPHOLE!!!!” reads the screen grabbed tweet. “If you don’t have insurance and can’t afford to take the $3,200 test for the virus ($1,000 with insurance), DONATE BLOOD. They HAVE to test you for the virus in order to donate blood. Tell your friends! Tell your family!!!!!” Potential donors and the donated blood itself does go through a series of tests for infectious diseases but, according to spokespeople from America’s Blood Centers and the American Red Cross, screening for COVID-19 isn’t part of that process. (RELATED: Did The Vatican Confirm Pope Francis Has The Novel Coronavirus?) “We do a whole range of testing on blood donations as required by the FDA, but screen or testing for coronavirus is not happening,” Kate Fry, chief executive officer of America’s Blood Centers, told The Associated Press. “There is no test to screen blood donations for the coronavirus and other respiratory viruses,” American Red Cross spokeswoman Greta Gustafson told the Daily Caller in an email. “It’s important to emphasize that there is no data or evidence that this coronavirus can be transmitted by blood transfusions, and there have been no reported cases of transfusion transmission for any respiratory virus, including this coronavirus, worldwide.”  The American Red Cross has requested that people refrain from donating blood for 28 days after being diagnosed with COVID-19  or coming into contact with someone who has the virus or is suspected to have it. Individuals who have recently traveled to China, Iran, Italy and South Korea should also postpone their donations for 28 days, according to the American Red Cross. Healthy individuals who meet blood donation criteria are eligible and encouraged to give blood, the American Red Cross website states.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Coronavirus tests consist of at least one swab from the nose and one swab from the throat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The tests come at no charge, but patients may have to pay for related medical services, like diagnostic scans and hospitalizations, according to Business Insider. The Twitter account that originated the claim in the Facebook post later issued a correction, saying, “I realize I tweeted something earlier that I didn’t research or thought would go anywhere and at a desperate attempt to help people who can’t afford the medical bills associated with testing for the virus, tweeted out misinformation.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157185054463857&set=a.399274688856&type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/VL0ko/status/1237759835321577473?s=20,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157185054463857&set=a.399274688856&type=3&theater,https://www.redcrossblood.org/biomedical-services/blood-diagnostic-testing/blood-testing.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/05/fact-check-vatican-confirm-pope-francis-coronavirus/,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8655910030,https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/coronavirus--covid-19--and-blood-donation.html,https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/coronavirus--covid-19--and-blood-donation.html,https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/dlp/coronavirus--covid-19--and-blood-donation.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/testing-laboratories.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-treatment-costs-america-expensive-2020-3#3-and-frank-wucinski-who-doesnt-have-insurance-was-billed-3918-for-a-government-mandated-quarantine-and-coronavirus-testing-for-him-and-his-daughter-3,https://twitter.com/VL0ko/status/1237759237893369856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4a0a6b1a2bba694b0b5bdb8adb7b5b8b8b1a6fab7bbb9",Do Blood Donors Automatically Get Tested For Coronavirus?,,,,,

Fact Check: The NBA suspended the 2019-2020 season on March 11 after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert became the first player to test positive for COVID-19, according to The New York Times. (RELATED: Did Lebron James Wear A ‘Same Crime’ Protest T-Shirt?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Basketball Updates Facebook page posted an image the following day falsely claiming Mudiay, a teammate of Gobert and a point guard on the Jazz, had also tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. In fact, Mudiay tweeted March 12 that he tested negative.  Firstly, thanks to everyone for the positive words. Yesterday I got tested for the Covid-19 virus. By God’s grace it came out negative.

On March 12, guard Donovan Mitchell confirmed that he too had tested positive for COVID-19.

The notice being shared on Facebook has been fabricated. Fact Check: Some doughnut and coffee lovers might have been alarmed to hear the rumor that Dunkin’ would be shuttering all of its more than 11,300 locations worldwide to help curb the spread of coronavirus. The claim appears to originate with a notice letter that has been making the rounds on social media platforms.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “To prevent the spread of COVID-19, all Dunkin’ locations will be closed for business starting March 18, 2020 until further notice,” reads the alleged notice. “Thank you for your patience and understanding.” But, according to a Dunkin’ spokesperson, the notice is fake, and the chain has no plans to close its restaurants on March 18. (RELATED: Did Costco Recall Kirkland Toilet Paper Due To Coronavirus Contamination?) “Contrary to rumors, Dunkin’ restaurants remain open to serve our guests at the drive-thru, with carry-out or delivery service,” said the Dunkin’ spokesperson in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Dunkin’ is committed to taking care of our guests and being a place of comfort during this difficult time. We and our franchisees are here to keep our guests running.” Dunkin’ is one of numerous chains that have pivoted to take-out, drive-through and delivery only to follow the recommendation from public health officials to practice social distancing. Other chains who have adopted these service practices include McDonald’s, KFC and Chick-fil-A, according to Business Insider.

She does not appear to own property in Boca Raton.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Fact Check: The claim that police raided Winfrey’s home in Boca Raton for evidence of sex trafficking became one of Twitter’s top trending topics Tuesday night. It has also appeared on Facebook, where a post featured images of a gated home blocked off with red tape. “The house of Oprah Winfrey in Boca Raton, Florida is being dis-assembled and checking the tunnels underground for child-sexual trafficking and other crimes against humanity!” reads the post. “And she happens to be a very closed friend of Harvey Weinstein.” A Twitter user also remarked, “Lmaooo Oprah Winfrey got arrested for running sex ring I always knew she was dirty.” (RELATED: Did A Florida Robber Use A Cough ‘As A Weapon’ Amid The Coronavirus Outbreak?)  The viral claim, however, has no merit. An internet search only turned up credible news outlets debunking the notion that she had been arrested in connection with a sex trafficking ring and her home had been raided.

Haven’t been raided, or arrested. Just sanitizing and self distancing with the rest of the world. Stay safe everybody.” The Boca Raton Police Department also denied she had been arrested.  The social media stories trending about @oprah being arrested by @bocapolice is absolutely false. https://t.co/4gyYsOocea — Boca Raton Police (@BocaPolice) March 18, 2020  “The social media stories trending about @oprah being arrested by @bocapolice is absolutely false,” the department tweeted. Winfrey does own, among other properties, a sprawling horse farm in Montecito, California, and a multimillion dollar vacation home in Telluride, Colorado, according to E! News. However, property records for Palm Beach County, where Boca Raton is located, do not show Winfrey having any homes in the area. The home featured in the Facebook post is currently listed for sale under Premier Estate Properties. Its listing on Zillow does not have Winfrey as the owner and puts the home’s value at $7,950,000. “Fake news,” Carmen DiAngelo, the listing agent for the property, told the Daily Caller in a phone interview. “That is incorrect information.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

No vaccines or specific treatments are currently available for the new coronavirus. Fact Check: Misinformation related to the new coronavirus has spread as the number of global COVID-19 cases continues to grow. (RELATED: Has A Vaccine For The Novel Coronavirus Been Used On Cows ‘For Years’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular post claims a liquid solution of silver particles can cure or prevent the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Multiple posts making the claim have linked to websites marketing colloidal silver products as a way to protect oneself from the new virus. But, according to the Food And Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), colloidal silver has no health benefits and even causes serious side effects. “Specific to colloidal silver, the FDA warned the public in a 1999 Final Rule that it isn’t safe or effective for treating any disease or condition,” said FDA spokesman Jeremy Cahn in an email to the Daily Caller. “The agency’s position on colloidal silver has not changed.” “There are no complementary products, such as colloidal silver or herbal remedies, that have been proven effective in preventing or treating this disease (COVID-19), and colloidal silver can have serious side effects,” said Dr. Helene Langevin, NCCIH director, said in a statement to The Associated Press.  Argyria, a bluish-gray discoloration of the skin, is the most common side effect of ingesting colloidal silver, according to the NCCIH. The FDA and Federal Trade Commission announced on March 9 that they had sent warning letters to seven companies selling products that fraudulently claim to prevent, treat or cure COVID-19. Products sold by these companies included teas, essential oils, tinctures and silver solutions. There are currently no vaccines or drugs approved to treat the disease.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The NCCIH notes that topical silver – not colloidal silver – has some medical uses, such as in dressing to treat burns and skin infections.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The claim likely stemmed from an August 2011 helicopter crash that killed 30 members of the U.S. military. Fact Check: The Department of Defense (DOD) reports that more than 2,300 U.S. service members have died in Afghanistan since October 2001. The March 12 post urges readers to honor Navy SEALs who allegedly died in the country the previous day.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “I am asking everyone to please take a moment of silence for the United States Navy Seal Team and their families,” the post says. “Their helicopter was shot down yesterday in Afghanistan and they lost 30 members of the team. It would be nice to see this on everyone’s page… even if it’s only for an hour.” Multiple Facebook users have shared the claim, despite no Navy SEALs perishing in Afghanistan on March 11. An internet search turned up no credible reports of 30 SEALs dying in an alleged March 11 incident. Neither the DOD nor the Department of the Navy have issued press releases. Media organizations often report on the deaths of American soldiers in Afghanistan. If 30 Navy SEALs had been killed after their helicopter was shot down, it would have been covered by the media, yet no outlets reported on it. The claim may have stemmed from a real incident that occurred on Aug. 6, 2011, when 30 American service members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan’s Wardak province. 17 of those who perished were Navy SEALs, according to the Navy press release.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/earl.porterfield.9/posts/2903007566430967,https://www.defense.gov/casualty.pdf,https://www.facebook.com/earl.porterfield.9/posts/2903007566430967,https://www.facebook.com/earl.porterfield.9/posts/2903007566430967,https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=%22Their%20helicopter%20was%20shot%20down%20yesterday%20in%20Afghanistan%20and%20they%20lost%2030%20members%20of%20the%20team.%22&epa=FILTERS&filters=eyJycF9jcmVhdGlvbl90aW1lIjoie1wibmFtZVwiOlwiY3JlYXRpb25fdGltZVwiLFwiYXJnc1wiOlwie1xcXCJzdGFydF9tb250aFxcXCI6XFxcIjIwMjAtMDNcXFwiLFxcXCJlbmRfbW9udGhcXFwiOlxcXCIyMDIwLTAzXFxcIn1cIn0ifQ%3D%3D,https://www.google.com/search?q=march+12+2020+afghanistan+killed+U.S.&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiG-pvo-J_oAhXGlXIEHXctC5MQ_AUIDSgA,https://search.usa.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=defensegov&sort_by=&query=afghanistan+SEAL,https://search.navy.mil/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=navy_all&sort_by=&query=afghanistan+30+killed+SEAL+March+11+2020+helicopter,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/world/asia/afghan-us-soldiers-shooting-deaths.html,https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-02-08/us-official-american-casualties-in-afghan-military-mission,https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=62111,https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=62111,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#abdfd9ceddc4d9ebcfcac2c7d2c8cac7c7ced985c8c4c6",Were 30 Navy SEALs Killed In A March 11 Attack In Afghanistan?,,,,,

Verdict: False There is no evidence gargling warm water with salt or vinegar protects people from the new coronavirus. No specific treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is currently available. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Amid the global spread of the new coronavirus, social media users have shared posts offering dubious prevention and treatment methods. (RELATED: Did The WHO Make A Coronavirus Infographic Warning Against Unprotected Sex With Animals?) “Corona virus before it reaches the lungs it remains in the throat for four days and at this time the person begins to cough and have throat pains,” claims a March 13 post. “If he drinks water a lot and gargling with warm water & salt or vinegar eliminates the virus.” However, the World Health Organization (WHO) website states that there is no evidence saline protects people from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Johns Hopkins University has also debunked the claim about gargling warm water with salt or vinegar. No specific treatment or vaccine is currently available for COVID-19. Some limited evidence does show that regularly rinsing the nose with saline can help with sore throats, but it isn’t effective for preventing respiratory infections like COVID-19, according to the WHO. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends thorough hand-washing, social distancing and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth to avoid being exposed to the virus.  The new coronavirus has sickened some 201,634 people and killed some 8,007 worldwide at the time of publication, according to an interactive Johns Hopkins University map.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It originated in a tweet from a user that has shared fake quotes in the past.

(RELATED: Did Trump Call The Coronavirus A ‘Hoax’ At His South Carolina Rally)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “CAPITOL HILL: @LindseyGrahamSC says @realDonaldTrump ‘probably knows more about medicine and specifically viruses than any of the so-called scientists at the NIH and CDC.

The comment would have been picked up by the media if Graham had actually said the words, yet no news outlets have reported on it. The quote does not appear on any of his social media pages either. Graham did release a statement Feb. 26 praising the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. However, at no point did he suggest the president knows more than experts at the National Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “President Trump’s decision to put Vice President Pence in charge of our nation’s efforts to contain the coronavirus is an excellent idea,” reads the statement. “And I have all the confidence in the world that the Vice President and his team will do everything in their power to contain this deadly virus.”  Dan Lyons, who describes himself as the “inventor of fake news” in his Twitter bio, tweeted the fabricated quote the same day Graham released that statement. He has shared fake quotes in the past, according to Snopes.

As of March 16, 22 individuals in Kentucky have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, according to the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “After a long and hard working meeting with all of the superintendents of Kentucky, we have came to the realization of the danger of the Corona Virus,” reads the alleged tweet. “This is a threat that we must act on. It is my displeasure to announce that all schools of Kentucky will be indefinitely closed March 16, 2020. Further information to come.” There is, however, no record of the Kentucky governor making the statement on Twitter on March 11 or any other date. Beshear only tweeted twice – at 6 p.m. and 7:27 p.m. – around the time of the supposed tweet, and neither announced that Kentucky schools were closing. The Kentucky Board of Education debunked the screen grabbed tweet in a statement on Twitter March 11.  ????: There is a fake social media post attributed to Gov. Andy Beshear circulating tonight that falsely states all of Kentucky’s schools will be closed starting March 16, 2020. This is FALSE.

Andy Beshear circulating tonight that falsely states all of Kentucky’s schools will be closed starting March 16, 2020,” reads the tweet. “This is FALSE.” Yet, while Beshear didn’t actually tweet the statement in the post, Kentucky public schools did stop in-person classes starting March 16 to help curb the spread of COVID-19 within the state. The closures will last at least two weeks with possibility of extension, according to WDRB News.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A search of video clip editing service Grabien turned up no matches for the quote. It does not appear on MSNBC’s website or social media accounts. Controversial statements by journalists often make headlines when they happen on live news broadcasts. If an MSNBC television personality had made the remark, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it. According to Snopes, the claim may have originated with a heavily edited video of MSNBC anchor Nicole Wallace and a Princeton University professor in which they made comparisons to Hurricane Katrina. The edited clip, Snopes reported, made it seem like the reporters were making light of the coronavirus outbreak.  Variations of the fake quote have continued to crop up on social media, despite no record of an MSNBC journalist ever making the statement.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/shannon.ward.712/posts/2732352970152889,https://www.facebook.com/shannon.ward.712/posts/2732352970152889,https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/03/09/fact-check-lysol-prove-coronavirus-new/,https://grabien.com/clipsbank.php?transcript=I%20hope%20enough%20people%20die%20from%20coronavirus&sources=MSNBC,http://www.msnbc.com/search/enough%20people%20die%20coronavirus,https://www.facebook.com/pg/msnbc/posts/?ref=page_internal,https://www.youtube.com/user/msnbcleanforward/search?query=%22enough+people+die%22,https://twitter.com/search?q=enough%20people%20die%20coronavirus%20(from%3AMSNBC)&src=typed_query,https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/msnbc-anchor-retires-after-sanders-nazi-analogy-sparks-controversy-1.8618284,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/chris-matthews-hardball-resigns-msnbc-bernie-sanders-nazis-a9371076.html,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/msnbc-hope-coronavirus-kills/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/msnbc-hope-coronavirus-kills/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec989e899a839eac888d8580958f8d8080899ec28f8381","Did An MSNBC Reporter Say, ‘I Hope Enough People Die From CoronaVirus That It Harms Trump’s Re-Election’?",,,,,

A recent study by U.S. government researchers found that the new coronavirus can survive up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to several days on plastic. “Because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website states.

Costco publicly lists current and past recall notices on its website. A search of that list turned up no recalls of Kirkland Signature brand bath tissue in the previous 120 days.

No vaccine against the novel coronavirus is currently available. Fact Check: The viral post uses the image of a canine coronavirus vaccine to suggest that the novel 2019 coronavirus isn’t new.

It has since spread to over 143 countries and territories and has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The outbreak, which has sickened some 153,517 people and killed some 5,735 others, was declared a global pandemic on March 11.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Mexico doesn’t have a single case of corona virus,” claims a March 7 Facebook post. “7Up, Vicks y sana sana colita de rana combo is undefeated.” Mexico has, contrary to the post’s claim, reported at least 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to the WHO’s March 15 situation report. On March 6, the day before the claim appeared on Facebook, Mexico had at least 5 confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Bernie Sanders.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Sanders does own three homes, two of which are in Vermont, but the pictured mansion isn’t one of them. It has other individuals listed as the owners. Fact Check: A viral image of a sprawling Vermont mansion has been making the rounds on social media, with this particular Facebook post claiming Sanders owns it. (RELATED: Did Bernie Sanders Say The US Has ‘Had Enough With White Men In Places Of Power’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Think Bernie’s going to share his mansions with the commoners?” reads the post. “This is Bernie Sanders’s home, one of three in fact, in Vermont. How does a public servant afford opulence like this.” The mansion, found through a reverse image search, is located in Stowe, a Vermont city east of Burlington, where Sanders served as mayor. It was most recently sold in 2017 for nearly $3 million, according to Zillow. However, the 2020 presidential hopeful isn’t listed as the owner. Sanders owns two houses in Vermont: a four-bedroom colonial in Burlington that he purchased in 2009 for $405,000 and a shorefront vacation home in North Hero that he purchased in 2016 for $575,000, according to Forbes. He also owns a townhouse in Washington, D.C., which he purchased in 2007 for roughly $489,000. He has an estimated net worth of $2.5 million, according to Forbes, and makes a $174,000 salary as a Vermont senator.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It appears to have originated on an Australian satire website. Fact Check: Hanks announced on March 11 that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, both tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Chinese Coronavirus Hospital In Wuhan)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Social media users started sharing the alleged photo of Hanks holding a volleyball resembling Wilson, his make-believe friend in the 2000 movie “Cast Away,” after the actor tweeted about the couple’s positive test results. Post captions say hospital staff gave Hanks the volleyball to “keep him company while quarantined” in Australia. The image, however, has been digitally manipulated. A still from a video clip of Hanks attending a 2015 New York Rangers hockey game has been superimposed onto a European Pressphoto Agency picture of a hospital room. It appears to have originated in a story that Australian satire website The Betoota Advocate published on March 11. Facebook and Twitter users then circulated that photo as being real. Hanks and his wife have been hospitalized in Queensland for isolation after experiencing fatigue, body aches and fevers. The actor was in Australia for pre-production work on a Baz Luhrmann-directed Elvis Presley biopic, according to CNN.  As of March 13, Australia has reported 156 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and three deaths, according to the Australian Department of Health website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/TandAmorningshow/photos/a.10152149877848151/10158220001343151/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/tomhanks/status/1237909897020207104,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/02/07/fact-check-image-coronavirus-hospital-wuhan/,https://www.facebook.com/TandAmorningshow/photos/a.10152149877848151/10158220001343151/?type=3&theater,https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B00C3L6B5W/ref=atv_dl_rdr,https://twitter.com/tomhanks/status/1237909897020207104,https://www.instagram.com/p/yupptgvdPM/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51317760,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51317760,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/13/coronavirus-tom-hanks-update/,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/entertainment/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-coronavirus-update/index.html,https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d797f687b627f4d696c6461746e6c6161687f236e6260",Does This Photo Show Tom Hanks Quarantined In Australia With Wilson The Volleyball?,,,,,

A spokesman for Clinton confirmed she never made the comment about taking “half of DC” with her. Fact Check: The claim that the former secretary of state made the statement has been circulating on social media since at least 2018, with this particular post saying, “Okay. Your terms are acceptable. Can we get it in writing??”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But there’s no record of Clinton ever actually saying or writing the words attributed to her in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller didn’t find any credible media reports of her making the statement. Searching her books and verified social media accounts didn’t turn up any matches either. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, confirmed to the Caller in an email that she never made the remark. She has never been publicly indicted on any charge.

Experts told the Daily Caller that lifeboats were not restricted to only white women and children. Fact Check: More than 1,500 passengers and crew died on the Titanic after the passenger ship hit an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic on its maiden voyage in 1912.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Titanic victim Malinda Borden was drowned at sea as she was working aboard the Titanic,” claims a Feb. 27 Facebook post. “Life boats (sic) were made available to white women and white children only. The Black workers were not listed among the passengers or victims. They were only listed among property that was lost.” There is, however, no record of a woman with the surname Borden on any Titanic passenger or crew list. A search of the Titanic records housed in the British National Archives and the Library of Virginia turned up no matches. “The only blacks on board were Joseph Laroche and his two children,” said historian Don Lynch of the Titanic Historical Society in an email to the Caller. “His wife was white.” Laroche, a French-educated Haitian engineer, perished on the Titanic but his French wife, Juliette, and their two children escaped the sinking ship on a lifeboat, according to the Titanic Historical Society. Their names appear on the Titanic’s second-class passenger list.  There were, according to Lynch, no black crew members on the ship. (RELATED: When Did Black People Get The Right To Vote?) “The Titanic carried passengers who were black, white, Hispanic, Asian, etc. Some of each survived,” Lynch said. “Lifeboats were not reserved for only white women and children.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Andrew Lound, author of the book “RMS Titanic: Made in the Midlands,” also confirmed in an email to the Caller that the post’s claim that about lifeboats doesn’t hold up, saying, “It is clear from the passengers who did get off that the crew did not discriminate on grounds of race, color, nationality, sex or age.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=624498054782678&set=a.156585354907286&type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Titanic,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=624498054782678&set=a.156585354907286&type=3&theater,http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/results/r?discoveryCustomSearch=true&_aq=borden&image1.x=0&image1.y=0&_aq=titanic&_aq=BT+27,https://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/titanic/passengers.php,https://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/titanic/crew.php,https://web.archive.org/web/20130518193720/http://www.titanichistoricalsociety.org/people/louise-laroche.asp,https://www.lva.virginia.gov/exhibits/titanic/passengers.php,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/06/06/fact-check-right-to-vote/,http://www.andrewlound.com/index_aboutme.htm,https://www.amazon.com/RMS-Titanic-Midlands-P-B-Lound/dp/0750967056,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2b5f594e5d44596b4f4a424752484a47474e5905484446",Did A Black Woman Drown In The Sinking Of The Titanic Because Lifeboats Were Only Open To White Women And Children?,,,,,

Alabama has not reported any confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus at press time. Fact Check: Featured in the viral post is an alleged screen grab of a chyron from a television news broadcast, saying, “Coronavirus found in crawfish in Mobile, AL.” The post claims that 12 women who recently ate crawfish contracted COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But the Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports about people in Mobile contracting COVID-19 from crawfish or any other food. In fact, there are no confirmed cases of respiratory virus in Alabama at press time, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. There is currently “no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food,” according to the CDC website. People can get COVID-19 from touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes, but coronaviruses generally spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. The image appears to have been created a website that allows people to create their own news chyrons. (RELATED: Did A Survey Find 38% Of Americans Won’t Drink Corona Beer Over Coronavirus Concerns?)

(Fareed Zakaria) ‘Post’ America means: The World ‘After’ America!” Verdict: False There is no evidence that Obama was “furious” about the picture or that he “tried to block” its publication. The conspiracy theory that Obama is secretly a Muslim has been previously debunked numerous times. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The New York Times photographer Doug Mills took the photo in May 2008 while Obama was campaigning in Montana and later published it. The image does, as the post claims, show Obama holding CNN Worldwide host and Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria’s book “The Post-American World.” (RELATED: Are Muslims Barred From Holding Public Office In The US?) There is, however, no indication that Obama was caught off-guard by the photograph or tried to stop its publication. At the time Mills was a known member of the press covering the then-presidential candidate on the campaign trail. No news reporting could be found to corroborate the claim that Obama was “furious” about the photo or that he “tried to block it.” Published in May 2008, Zakaria’s book was a New York Times bestseller and critically acclaimed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Foreign Affairs and others. It paints a picture of a future where other nations match the U.S. in terms of geopolitical, economic and cultural power. Zakaria has stated that, despite the title, the book is not about the “decline” of American, but rather “about the rise of everyone else.” The post’s claim that Obama is Zakaria’s “fellow Muslim” doesn’t hold up either. Zakaria wrote in a 2015 op-ed for the Washington Post that he was “not a practicing Muslim.” The conspiracy theory that Obama secretly practices Islam dates back over a decade and has been throughly debunked numerous times.

The claim came from a Twitter handle mimicking the BBC Breaking News account that has since been suspended. Fact Check: The false claim that the British actor widely known for his role in the “Harry Potter” franchise tested positive has circulated on Twitter and Facebook since Tuesday, with this particular post saying, “He becomes the first confirmed famous person to have the virus. We wish a speedy recovery!”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Twitter account @BBCNewsTonight spread the claim in a viral March 10 tweet that was later retweeted by multiple verified handles. Inspection of the account revealed it had no affiliation with the British outlet, despite closely resembling the verified BBC Breaking News account. The handle, which lacked a blue verification check mark and had less than 200 followers, has since been suspended. (RELATED: Does This Video Show The Market Where The Coronavirus Outbreak Originated?) Scott Boute, a representative for Radcliffe, told The Associated Press that the claim was not true. The actor recently made a return to the theater for a London production of Samuel Beckett’s “Endgame” in February, according to Playbill. The U.K. has documented more than 350 cases of the novel coronavirus and at least six deaths as of March 11.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/themoesamir/photos/a.488989241980075/502262507319415/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/themoesamir/photos/a.488989241980075/502262507319415/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/BBCNewsTonight/status/1237347552321830912,https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking,https://twitter.com/BBCNewsTonight/status/1237347552321830912,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/02/19/fact-check-video-market-coronavirus-orginated-wuhan-indonesia/,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8610521777,https://www.playbill.com/article/a-look-at-the-old-vics-endgame-with-daniel-radcliffe-and-alan-cumming,https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public#number-of-cases,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#483c3a2d3e273a082c292124312b2924242d3a662b2725",Does ‘Harry Potter’ Actor Daniel Radcliffe Have The Novel Coronavirus?,,,,,

No excuses!”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  There is no evidence that Trump ever tweeted the statement. The person who shared the tweet originally has admitted that it was created in jest. Fact Check:  The viral post features two screen grabs: one of the alleged February 2015 tweet and one of a CNN story titled, “Dow falls 1,191 points — the most in history.” That article recounts how, on Feb. 27, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 1,100 points amid concerns over the novel coronavirus outbreak and a crash in oil prices, tipping it into correction territory.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, Trump never actually wrote the screen grabbed tweet included in the Facebook post. A search of Trump’s verified Twitter accounts — @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS — turned up no matches. (RELATED: Did Trump Tweet, ‘Handicapped And Minority Children Are Too Disruptive In The Classroom’?)

Tom Wolf has mandated all schools and workplaces with 20 or more employees close for two weeks to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Wolf mandating these measures. The local affiliate mentioned in the post has not published any reports about mandated school or workplace closures. Fact Check: The number of known coronavirus cases in the U.S. surpassed 1,000 on March 10 as the outbreak continues to spread worldwide. At press time, Pennsylvania has 2 confirmed and 13 presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral post masquerading as a breaking news alert from local affiliate Pittsburgh’s Action 4 News claims the Pennsylvania governor has mandated school and workplace closures in response to the outbreak. The accompanying link to the “full article” leads to a 403 error page. “ALL schools will be closed for 2 weeks beginning March 12, 2020,” reads the post. “Schools and workplaces with 20 or more employees will resume after 2 weeks of the mandatory closure. A list of all schools and businesses in your area can be found on this list.” But the Daily Caller found no press releases announcing these mandates on the Pennsylvania governor’s website. Nor did the local affiliate station publish any media reports about them. “The Wolf Administration is aware of the fake meme,” said Nate Wardle, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Health Department, in an email to the Caller. “It is important that people are getting their coronavirus information from reputable sources, such as the Pennsylvania Department of Health. If a news outlet was to post something like this, it would come from their account.”  Jim Parsons, the news director at Pittsburgh’s Action 4 News, confirmed to the Caller that the local affiliate did not publish the information. (RELATED: Did The WHO Make A Coronavirus Infographic Warning Against Unprotected Sex With Animals?) “This has nothing to do with us, and we did not post this information anywhere on any platform,” Parsons said. “It’s bogus information that is being spread on social media.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  There have been some school closures and event cancelations across Pennsylvania over concerns about the novel coronavirus.

Verdict: False There is no record of UNICEF publishing such guidance. A UNICEF spokesperson said the letter is “NOT from UNICEF and is not accurate.” Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Health agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have put out recommendations for avoiding infection as the novel coronavirus has spread to at least 110 countries around the world. The Facebook post claims to show a letter from UNICEF offering some dubious tips on preventing the virus, including “any mask prevents its entry” and “gargle with warm and salt water.” But the Daily Caller searched the UNICEF website and found nothing matching or similar to the contents of the alleged letter. A UNICEF spokesman, Christopher Tidey, confirmed to the Caller that the letter is “NOT from UNICEF and is not accurate.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims A Lysol Product Label Proves The Coronavirus Isn’t A ‘New Virus’) “Misinformation during times of a health crisis can result in people being left unprotected or more vulnerable to the virus,” Tidey said in an email. “It can also spread paranoia, fear, and stigmatization, and have other consequences like offering a false sense of protection.” Measures to prevent COVID-19 include washing your hands often, using hand sanitizer when soap and water is not available and avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. The CDC only recommends health workers and people sick with the novel virus or under investigation for it wear masks.   Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!

Bernie Sanders marching with civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965.               View this post on Instagram                     Bernie marching alongside Martin Luther King Jr in a 1965 Civil Rights March from Selma to Montgomery A post shared by  CHNGE ™ (@chnge) on Mar 7, 2020 at 5:46am PST     googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Bernie marching alongside Martin Luther King Jr in a 1965 Civil Rights March from Selma to Montgomery,” reads the caption. Verdict: False While the man pictured bears some passing resemblance to Sanders in his youth, there is no evidence to suggest it is actually him. Sanders has never claimed to have attended the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Taken March 26, 1965, the genuine photograph shows King, his wife and other prominent civil rights activists leading thousands of people during the last leg of the Selma-to-Montgomery march. That march, widely considered a watershed moment of the civil rights movement, consisted of a series of demonstrations against black voter suppression. The viral Instagram post identifies a young white man with glasses and curly hair a few rows behind King as Sanders, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. (RELATED: Viral Meme Miscaptions Bernie Sanders Arrest Photo From 1963) But aside from some physical resemblance to the Vermont senator in his youth, there is no evidence that the man circled is Sanders. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any record of Sanders claiming to have attended the march in his decades-long political career. In fact, Sanders gave a speech at an event commemorating the march in 2019 and made no mention of being present. Sanders became involved in social activism during his time at the University of Chicago in the early ’60s, helping organize a sit-in to protest segregated off-campus housing and serving as a student leader of the Congress of Racial Equality. In 1963, he attended the March on Washington, where King delivered his famous “I Have A Dream” speech.  The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

No vaccine against the novel coronavirus is currently available. Fact Check: Featured in the image is a medicine vial with the words “Bovine Rotavirus-Coronavirus Vaccine” printed on its label.

Bovine coronavirus is part of the coronavirus family but distinct from the novel 2019 coronavirus that had not been previously identified in humans before December. No vaccine for COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel virus, is currently available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “More than 20 vaccines are in development globally, and several therapeutics are in clinical trials,” World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told the Daily Caller in an email. “We expect the initial results within a few weeks.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that range from the common cold to Middle East respiratory syndrome. Fact Check: As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak continues to spread, so have false claims that companies knew about the new coronavirus before the outbreak.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “This is a can of Lysol from 2016 that was used in a corporate training film,” claims one such post. “You can see that it states that this product prevents the spread of Human Coronavirus. That’s odd because we were told on January 5, 2020 that this is a ‘new virus’ from China.” The pictured “Human Coronavirus” label, however, isn’t a specific reference to the novel 2019 coronavirus. The post appears to confuse the generic “human coronavirus” term with the novel 2019 virus that had not been previously identified in humans prior to it emerging in China in December. Per the World Health Organization (WHO), coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Human coronaviruses, of which there are seven that can infect people, were first identified in the 60s, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cleaning brands, including Lysol, can put the pictured label on certain products because they have previously proven effective against other strains of coronavirus – not because they knew about the virus before the outbreak started. (RELATED: Does A Bill Gates-Funded Research Institute Own The Patent For Coronavirus?)  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) allows disinfectant makers to apply for approval to claim their products are effective against new viruses through its Emerging Viral Pathogen program if data shows their products are “effective against harder-to-kill viruses.” Through that process, Lysol and other cleaning product companies received approval to note their products are “qualified for use against SARS-CoV-2,” the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2875105282547795&set=a.141738142551203&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2875105282547795&set=a.141738142551203&type=3&theater,https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus,https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally,https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus,https://www.cdc.gov/sars/index.html,https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html,https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/ppls/000777-00099-20190607.pdf,https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/ppls/000777-00114-20191126.pdf,https://www.atcc.org/products/all/VR-740.aspx#generalinformation,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/01/31/fact-check-bill-gates-pirbright-institute-patent-coronavirus/,https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/emerging-viral-pathogen-guidance-antimicrobial-pesticides,https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-releases-list-disinfectants-use-against-covid-19,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebabcabb8a1bc8eaaafa7a2b7adafa2a2abbce0ada1a3",Viral Image Claims A Lysol Product Label Proves The Coronavirus Isn’t A ‘New Virus’,,,,,

There is no indication that the CDC recommends wearing only certain types of facial hair to prevent the spread of the virus. Fact Check:  As the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, continues to spread around the globe, so has misinformation about protecting oneself from the virus. (RELATED: Did ‘The Simpsons’ Predict The Coronavirus Outbreak?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Multiple social media users have circulated an infographic from the CDC that shows dozens of facial hair styles that are compatible and incompatible with filtering facepiece respirators. Some use the graphic to allege the CDC “recommended wearing only certain types of beard styles to help prevent the spread of coronavirus.” But the infographic making the rounds on social media has no connection to the viral respiratory illness. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health released it and an accompanying blog post in November 2017. The graphic was intended to guide employers and workers who wear respirators at their jobs to protect them from inhaling chemicals and infectious particles, according to the CDC website. “We wanted to raise awareness among workers and employers – our target audience for this infographic and blog – that facial hair that lies along the sealing area of a respirator will cause a respirator to leak,” said CDC spokeswoman Leslie Dorigo in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The presence of facial hair under the sealing surface causes 20 to 1,000 times more leakage compared to clean-shaven individuals.” The CDC recommends the use of face masks for people exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 or under investigation for having the virus. Health workers and people taking care of someone with the virus in close settings should also wear masks, according to the CDC website.  “CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a face mask to protect themselves from respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19,” Dorigo told the DCNF.

The Vatican has denied his illness is anything other than a “slight illness.” Fact Check: Pope Francis cancelled some engagements after he was seen coughing and blowing his nose during Ash Wednesday Mass on Feb. 29. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Chinese Coronavirus Hospital In Wuhan)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The website MCM News published an article alleging Pope Francis and two aides tested positive for the novel respiratory virus.

But the Daily Caller didn’t find any credible media reports about the pope contracting the novel coronavirus. Nor does a press release confirming a coronavirus diagnosis for the pope or his aides appear on the Vatican’s website. The Vatican has denied the claim and described Pope Francis as having a “slight illness” without giving further details. Matteo Bruni, a Vatican spokesman, told reporters that “there is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition.” The 83-year-old pontiff, who lost a lung to an illness as a young man, made his first public appearance since his “slight illness” on March 1, according to Reuters.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2484795228503142&id=100009180660573,https://time.com/5794364/pope-francis-cold-not-coronavirus/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/02/07/fact-check-image-coronavirus-hospital-wuhan/,https://mcmnt.com/vatican-confirms-pope-francis-and-two-aides-test-positive-for-coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR3s4n5zgjVTIE3jX5o7wO9x740euqKS4etaKTUnug-ri-3Zv0v3CsALyIw,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/world/europe/coronavirus-italy-elderly.html,https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/no-pope-francis-does-not-have-coronavirus,https://time.com/5794364/pope-francis-cold-not-coronavirus/,https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/485650-pope-francis-tests-negative-for-coronavirus,http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/ricerca.html?date=2020&q=coronavirus,https://apnews.com/c857823e5212f4da2bf6ed3b451ba3c2,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-health/pope-makes-first-public-appearance-following-illness-idUSKBN20O1NC,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-health/pope-makes-first-public-appearance-following-illness-idUSKBN20O1NC,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#562224332039241632373f3a2f35373a3a33247835393b",Did The Vatican Confirm Pope Francis Has The Novel Coronavirus?,,,,,

Verdict: False The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any proof to support the post’s claim. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that while the disease can be transmitted through infected objects and surfaces, there is no evidence that it can spread through food. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image appears to be the latest example of coronavirus misinformation that’s become rampant on social media websites. As of March 4, the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has spread from China to at least 76 other countries, sickening some 93,090 people and killing some 3,198 others, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). No corroborating evidence or news reports could be found to support the image’s claim that coronavirus has been found in bags of rice. In fact, the CDC website notes that while the respiratory virus can be spread through touching infected objects or surfaces, there is “no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food.” “In general, because of the poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures,” states the CDC website.

A NASA spokeswoman confirmed the operation was planned in advance. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    UFO enthusiast Scott Waring spotted the supposed UFO while watching a Feb. 21 ISS livestream. In the video, the object in question can be seen floating below the ISS for roughly 22 minutes before disappearing from the camera’s view. (RELATED: Did NASA Spend More Than $165 Million To Develop Pens That Work In Space?) Waring posted a video – which has over 573,600 views to date – about the object on his YouTube channel ET Data Base, where he labeled it a UFO and speculated about its origins. Some media outlets, like Metro Express and BroBible, picked up the story and similarly labeled it a UFO. The object, however, is actually the Japanese Experiment Module Inter-orbit Communication System–Exposed Facility. It got jettisoned from the ISS at approximately 1:50 p.m. EST on Feb. 21, according to the ISS daily summary report from that day. The ISS commonly disposes of debris via controlled jettisons. NASA astronaut Doug Wheelock explained the disposal jettison during an interview on the syndicated comedy radio program “The Rick and Bubba Show.”  “In a controlled fashion, at the right moment, at the right time and the right trajectory we released this – or we jettisoned this piece of hardware to return ashes to ashes, dust to dust back to the planet,” said Wheelock. “It’s a known piece of hardware, it’s a piece of communication hardware which we’ve upgraded since that time.” Stephanie Schierholz, a NASA spokeswoman, confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation that it was “a planned event to dispose of the unused part.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

James Inhofe now serves as the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) chief of staff.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Inhofe currently serves as a senator for the state of Oklahoma. A spokesperson for the EPA told the Daily Caller that former EPA Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Molina took over the chief of staff role in an acting capacity in late February. Fact Check: The viral image, posted Feb. 18, falsely claims that Inhofe, who currently chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, now serves as the EPA’s chief of staff. “So remember the idiot who brought a snowball onto the Senate floor to ‘prove global warming is a hoax?” reads the caption. “He’s now Trump’s EPA’s chief of staff.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But a spokesperson for the EPA told the Caller in an email that Molina has actually taken over the role in an acting capacity. (RELATED: Were The First 23 Black Senators Republicans?) “Ryan Jackson’s last day as Chief of Staff at the EPA was February 21st, at which time Michael Molina became Acting Chief of Staff,” Molly Block said. Ryan Jackson, who the EPA still lists as the chief of staff on its website, left the agency to join the National Mining Association as a lobbyist, according to The Hill. He previously served as a top aid for Inhofe and as a staff director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, according to the EPA website. The Washington Post reported Feb. 14 that Mandy Gunasekara, a former top EPA air policy official, has been tapped to return as the agency’s chief of staff, but the EPA hasn’t made any announcements to that effect at the time of publication.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It purportedly shows the Columbia University student ID of Barry Soetoro listed as a “foreign student.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Obama, who was born in Hawaii, used the last name Soetoro, the surname of his stepfather, as a boy in Indonesia but later stopped using it, according to The New York Times. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama Tweet, ‘Ask Ukraine If They Found My Birth Certificate’?) He transferred from Occidental College after two years in 1981 to Columbia University, where there is no record of Obama ever going by Soetoro. In fact, an essay Obama published in the university’s weekly Sundial magazine has the byline “Barack Obama.” The student ID card, Snopes reported, actually belongs to a former Columbia student named Thomas Lugert, whose ID number matches that in the post. It was digitally altered to have a photo of Obama and to replace the word “student” with the words “foreign student” after being posted online in 1998. According to the Columbia University Record, the school didn’t start using digital ID cards like the one in the post until 1996. Their implementation took place after Obama graduated.  A Chicago Tribune photographer took the photo of Obama featured in the doctored student ID in 1999 while he was an Illinois state senator, according to its caption.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

None volunteered for the position during the Obama administration, it also claims.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False White House sentries are typically assigned to the position. A Marine Corps spokesperson has said the number of volunteers is around a dozen, not in the thousands. Fact Check: Featured in the post is a photo of a Marine escorting First Lady Melania Trump on her husband’s inauguration day. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims 11 US Marines Died ‘This Week’)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “13,506 Marines have applied for Whitehouse (sic) duty since the inauguration of President Trump,” a block of text below that reads. “In the previous eight years, no Marines volunteered for this duty, they had to be ‘assigned.’ Speaks volumes.” White House Marine sentries stand outside the door of the West Wing whenever the president is working, according to a 2009 video published by the White House. Four work at a time in shifts of 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off to open the door for people coming and going from the building. “Most Marines who serve at the White House are assigned to that position based on the needs of the Marine Corps, after a lengthy and detailed screening process, not – except in rare cases – because they volunteered,” Maj. Brian Block, Marine Corps communications directorate, told The Associated Press (AP).

Verdict: False Trump referred to the alleged “politicizing” of the coronavirus by Democrats as “their new hoax.” He did not refer to the coronavirus itself as a hoax. Throughout the speech, Trump reiterates his administration is taking the threat of the coronavirus seriously. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Politico appears to misconstrue the subject of the president’s statement, claiming that Trump “tried to cast the global outbreak of the coronavirus as a liberal conspiracy intended to undermine his first term.” But an examination of the video and transcript show Trump actually described Democratic complaints about his handling of the virus threat as “their new hoax.” “We have exposed the far left’s corruption and defeated their sinister schemes and let’s see what happens in the coming months,” Trump said during the rally. “Let’s watch. Let’s just watch. Very dishonest people. Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, you know that right? Coronavirus, they’re politicizing it.” The novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, has spread from China to 53 other countries, sickening 85,403 people and killing 2,924 others as of Saturday, according to the World Health Organization. Some Democrats, including former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden, have criticized the administration’s response to the outbreak as rudderless and ill-prepared due to Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health budget cuts and leadership by Trump. But The Associated Press called this characterization “distorted” since the agencies haven’t seen loss of funding and have a “playbook to follow for pandemic preparation” regardless of who’s president.  Trump described the so-called “politicizing” of the White House’s response to the disease as what he perceives to be an attempt to undermine his administration, likening it to impeachment and the Mueller investigation. (RELATED: Are There 8 Confirmed Coronavirus Cases In Nashville?) “They tried anything,” said Trump about a minute after his first mention of the coronavirus. “They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  When looking at the entirety of Trump’s remarks, it appears the “new hoax” comment refers to the alleged Democratic “politicizing” of his response to the coronavirus threat – not the coronavirus itself. The Hill, the Daily Beast and Slate, among other outlets, reported that the “hoax” comment was talking about Democratic criticism. Slate said, “Trump Slams Democrats Over Coronavirus Criticism: ‘This Is Their New Hoax,'” while the Daily Beast posted, “Trump: Democrats’ Coronavirus Criticism A ‘New Hoax.'” At no point in the rally does Trump directly call the novel coronavirus outbreak a “hoax” or “conspiracy.” In fact, he refers to the respiratory virus as a “public health threat” and reiterates “we have to take it very, very seriously. That’s what we’re doing. We are preparing for the worst.” Trump denied that he called the coronavirus a “hoax” in a Feb. 29 press conference. He said he was “referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody because we’ve done such a good job. The hoax is on them. I’m not talking about what’s happening here. I’m talking what they’re doing. That’s the hoax,” according to NBC News. The president and Vice President Pence, who has been placed in charge of the administration’s response to the outbreak, announced new travel restrictions involving Iran and increased travel advisories for Italy and South Korea at the press conference as well. The new measures come after Washington health officials announced the first death in the U.S. from the novel coronavirus.

February 22, 2020 — they’re getting closer!” Verdict: False  Claiborne pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. in April 2019, after sharing information with Chinese agents in exchange for money and gifts. There is no evidence she worked directly with Hillary Clinton or as her “spokesman” while Clinton was secretary of state. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Claiborne began working at the State Department in 1999 as an office management specialist and had overseas postings in Beijing and Shanghai, among other places, according to Fox News. From 2011 to 2016, she passed Chinese intelligence agents non-classified documents in exchange for money and gifts, according to a Justice Department press release. The FBI arrested Claiborne in March 2017. The viral post, however, gets key facts about Claiborne’s case wrong. (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton Lie To The FBI?) Claiborne pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. — not treason, as the post incorrectly suggests — and was sentenced to 40 months in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $40,000, per the Justice Department press release. Prosecutors dropped other counts of felony obstruction, lying to the FBI and wire fraud after she accepted that plea deal, according to The Washington Post.  The date of her guilty plea is also wrong. Claiborne accepted the plea deal in April 2019 and got sentenced three months later in July. While Claiborne was employed at the State Department during Clinton’s tenure, there is no evidence she worked as Clinton’s “spokesperson” or worked directly with her in any capacity.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  We rate the post false.

The female twins in the upper photo have not been separated, and the male twins in the lower photo do not appear to have ever been conjoined. Fact Check: A former neurosurgeon, Carson has served as HUD secretary since March 2017, after running against President Donald Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. He received international attention in 1987, when he led the surgical separation of German conjoined twins named Patrick and Benjamin Binder, according to the Washington Post.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The post features two photographs – one of two babies joined at the head and one of two young men who appear to be twins – and claims, “These are the Conjoined twins that Dr Ben Carson Separated in 1987.” However, neither photo shows the Binder twins. (RELATED: Did Ben Carson Call Homelessness ‘A Gift From Heaven’?) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the upper photo shows Canadian conjoined twins Krista and Tatiana Hogan. The Globe and Mail published the photo, taken by a staff photographer, in a 2009 article. The Hogan twins were born in 2006 and cannot be surgically separated due to the nature of their conjoining, according to cbc.ca. The lower photo shows twins Carson and Cramer Gormley posing for a picture with their car, per its caption. The 2008 article Michigan Live published about them put their ages at 18, meaning they were born in either 1989 or 1990. The Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports of them being conjoined at birth.  One iteration of the claim has been shared more than 211,000 times, despite not showing the twins Carson separated in 1987.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/bencitytimes01/posts/2609798905762815,https://www.hud.gov/about/Secretary,https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/primaries/parties/republican,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/the-story-of-the-surgery-that-made-ben-carson-famous--and-its-complicated-aftermath/2015/11/13/15b5f900-88c1-11e5-be39-0034bb576eee_story.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/12/09/fact-check-ben-carson-obama-mark-levin-skin-color/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/decade-in-images/article794139/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/decade-in-images/article794139/,https://www.google.com/search?q=conjoinment&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS850US850&oq=conjoinment&aqs=chrome..69i57.1708j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.mlive.com/flintjournal/people/2008/02/for_twins_sharing_senior_year.html,https://www.mlive.com/flintjournal/people/2008/02/for_twins_sharing_senior_year.html,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=956701251072785&set=a.474365745973007&type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#72060017041d003216131b1e0b11131e1e17005c111d1f",Do These Photos Show The Conjoined Twins Ben Carson Separated In 1987?,,,,,

His airline, Trump Shuttle, operated flights between New York, Boston and Washington D.C. from 1989 to 1992. Fact Check: The post, allegedly written by a male soldier, describes that he and other American service members had to wait four days in 1991 for buses to take them to the airport, where there was a shortage of planes meant to take them home to the U.S. The owner of Tower Air offered his planes to bring the troops home from Saudi Arabia, the post claims.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “That Private was me, Ron Knouse,” claims the post. “The owner of Tower Air was – Donald J. Trump.” (RELATED: Has Trump Been ‘Very Strict’ On Commercial Aviation?) Yet, while Tower Air did charter overseas passenger and cargo flights for the Department of Defense in the 90s, the airline was never owned by Trump. Tower Air was founded by Morris Nachtomi, Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill and Sam Fondlier, according to Airline History records. It ceased operations in 2002. John Chanda, the former director of technical services for Tower Air, told the Daily Caller in a phone interview that Trump never came up in any of his business conversations with Nachtomi. Trump did operate an airline from 1989 to 1992, but it was called Trump Shuttle. It operated flights to New York, Boston and Washington D.C., Business Insider reported. Some of his planes did transport military personnel domestically but, according to the Washington Post, the U.S military arranged the charters.  The story has circulated online since at least 2016.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jack.lawler.391/posts/2904559586263344,https://www.facebook.com/jack.lawler.391/posts/2904559586263344,https://web.archive.org/web/20000510082236/http://www.towerair.com/about-cb.cfm,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/01/03/fact-check-has-trump-been-very-strict-on-commercial-aviation/,https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/19/us/charter-airlines-carry-many-military-travelers.html,https://airlinehistory.co.uk/airline/tower-air/,https://web.archive.org/web/20060428210209/http://airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/cessations/tower2.htm,https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-r-chanda-4a09002b,https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-airline-shuttle-transportation-pan-am-eastern-new-york-2019-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2018/01/02/the-ups-and-mostly-downs-of-trump-shuttle-the-presidents-long-defunct-airline/,https://myrightwingdad.blogspot.com/2016/03/fw-fwd-desert-storm-getting-home.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#81f5f3e4f7eef3c1e5e0e8edf8e2e0edede4f3afe2eeec",Did Trump Fly US Soldiers Back From Operation Desert Storm On His Airline?,,,,,

Fact Check: Featured in the top image are what the post claims are Satanic symbols, along with a definition of the “Horned Hand” that explains the gesture is “a sign of recognition between and allegiance of members of Satanism or other unholy groups.” A photo of Pope Francis and Filipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle making a hand gesture with the thumb, index and pinky fingers extended appears below that.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral post combines the two images to suggest Pope Francis made a hand gesture saluting Satan, saying, “It’s all in plain sight (for those who have eyes to see it).” (RELATED: Did In-N-Out Burger Print ‘Hail Satan’ On Its Soda Cups?) However, the hand gesture the religious men are making in the photo is not satanic in nature, as the post claims. The pope was actually making the ASL sign for “I love you” at the Mall of Asia arena in the Philippines in January 2015, per the photo caption. While the ASL sign does bear some resemblance to the “sign of the horns” some view as a satanic gesture, it has a key difference. The “sign of the horns” needs the thumb toward the palm; the “I love you” sign needs it to be extended. The “sign of the horns” has cultural meanings unrelated to satanism, including showing spirit for sports teams at some universities and expressing enthusiasm at heavy metal concerts.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Bernie Sanders making racist remarks in front of schoolchildren.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The video was deceptively edited to remove the context around Sanders’ comments. He was actually explaining how harmful stereotypes develop and perpetuate about certain groups of people. Fact Check: The short clip that’s making the rounds on social media comes from the public access channel television show “Bernie Speaks with the Community” that the Vermont senator hosted while he was mayor of Burlington. It appears to come from the Dec. 4, 1987 episode in which Sanders spoke to Edmund Middle School Paradise Project students about racial stereotypes.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “All the Irish people do is drink. That’s the Irish,” Sanders says. “All Italians are gangsters, and Irish are drunk, and Jews are greedy, and black people smell. Okay?” Here’s the full video of the roughly hour-long episode:  The Daily Caller reviewed the episode in its entirety and found that the viral clip has been deceptively edited to make it appear like Sanders is making derogatory comments about black, Italian, Irish and Jewish people. The clip leaves out important context that he was actually explaining how some people develop and perpetuate racial stereotypes about certain groups of people to “dehumanize them.”  “If you want to deal with a group of people, if you want to do bad things to them, you do what I call, dehumanize them,” Sanders explained. “You make them less than human beings – they’re not like you, they’re something else. And what you do, therefore, is you develop a stereotypical image of them.” He also asked the middle school students to provide examples of stereotypes they’ve heard and offered some that he’d heard about different races and nationalities. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Joe Biden Making A Racist Remark)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The deceptively edited clip excludes Sanders discussing the negative impact of racial stereotypes with the children. In the full video, it’s clear that Sanders was criticizing the stereotypes, not expressing his personal views.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The Daily Herald confirmed that the picture was taken at that clean up event, according to FactCheck.org.

Verdict: False The survey found that 38 percent of beer-drinking – not all – Americans said they would not buy Corona beer. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The PR firm 5W Public Relations released the results of a survey on Friday that asked American beer drinkers their opinions about Mexican lager Corona “as a result of the deadly coronavirus that’s spreading around the world.” The survey comes roughly a month after Google Trends noted an increase in “corona beer virus,” “beer virus” and “beer coronavirus” searches online. On the same day of the survey’s release, the Daily Mail published an article with the headline saying, “Coronavirus fear sparks boycott of Corona BEER as survey finds 38 percent of Americans say they now won’t drink the lager.” That headline, however, misrepresents the findings of the survey. The phone survey of 737 beer-drinking Americans found 38 percent said they would not buy it “under any circumstances now.” Among those who indicated they regularly drink Corona, 4 percent said they would stop drinking it, and 14 percent said they wouldn’t order it in public. The survey also found that 16 percent of “beer-drinking Americans were confused about whether Corona beer is related to the coronavirus.” Ronn Torossian, the founder and CEO of 5W Public Relations, gave the Daily Caller a list of “yes” or “no” questions that the firm asked:  “Do you drink beer?” “Would you buy Corona Beer under any circumstances now?” “If you usually drink Corona Beer, will you continue drinking it?” “Would you order it in a public venue?” “Are you confused about whether Corona Beer is related to the Corona Virus?”  According to The Dispatch and The Atlantic, other questions asked in the survey included “Is Corona related to the coronavirus?” and “In light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona?” Torossian did not give The Atlantic the results for those questions. The press release did not provide the complete list of survey questions, the results of the all asked questions or the survey’s margin of error. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Rhino Horns Are The Source Of The Novel Coronavirus)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The claim that 38 percent of Americans won’t buy Corona over concerns about coronavirus appears to have originated with a CNN tweet that misrepresented the results of the survey.

A spokesman for Kissinger confirmed that the three dubious quotes are “entirely fictitious.” Fact Check:  Only two of the quotes attributed to Kissinger in the post, which features a long block of text and several dubious quotes, appear to be genuine. They come from a December 2016 “Face The Nation” interview in which Kissinger discussed the foreign policy implication of Trump’s presidency.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven’t seen,” Kissinger said in the interview – and the post accurately quotes. (RELATED: Did Henry Kissinger Say ‘Forcible Vaccination’ Would Lead To ‘Extermination Services’?) It also more or less accurately quotes the former secretary of state as saying, “One, their perception that the previous president or the outgoing president basically withdrew America from international politics, so that they had to make their own assessment of their necessities and, secondly, that here is a new president who is asking a lot of unfamiliar questions.” But the other three quotes about “eight years of tyranny,” Trump being “the one true leader” and there being “not a single thing wrong with him” do not appear anywhere in that interview transcript or elsewhere. Jessica LePorin, a spokesperson for Kissinger, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation that those quotes were “entirely fictitious.” Kissinger has met with Trump a number of times to discuss foreign policy and spoken publicly about the president on occasion, according to media reports.

Fact Check:  As the coronavirus, known as COVID-19, continues to spread, so does misinformation about the disease. In this case, a viral article claims Africans are genetically resistant to the novel respiratory virus.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The article said that 21-year-old Cameroonian student Kem Senou Pavel Daryl’s recovery from COVID-19 helped Chinese doctors make the discovery. “The Chinese doctors confirmed that Senou stayed alive because of his blood genetic composition which is mainly found in the genetic composition of subsaharan Africans,” the article claims. “Chinese doctors also said that he remained alive because he had black skin, the antibodies of a black are 3 times stronger, powerful and resistant compare (sic) to that of white.” The 21-year-old student contracted COVID-19 while living in the Chinese city of Jingzhou and suffered from a fever, cough and other flu-like symptoms, according to BBC News. There is, however, no scientific evidence suggesting that Africans have a better chance of fighting the coronavirus. In fact, a medical epidemiologist and a microbiologist debunked the claim in an email to the DCNF.  “This claim is entirely false,” Washington State University epidemiologist Isaac Ngere said. “No scientific proof that Africans have any immunity to COVID-19 or any coronaviruses.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims Cocaine ‘Kills’ The Coronavirus) Paul Hunter, a microbiologist at the University of East Anglia, called the article’s claim that Africans are less genetically susceptible to the coronavirus “absolute rubbish.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “It is true that in the 2002/2003 SARS epidemic only one case was identified in Africa (South Africa). Also during the 2009 influenza pandemic Africa suffered less than on other continents,” said Hunter. “However, this is more likely to be because of other geographical factors (i.e. generally lower population densities and Africans spend more time out of doors where transmission is less effective than Europeans do, especially in winter). No evidence that any of these factors are down to immunity.” As of Feb. 27, the WHO has documented at least two cases of COVID-19 in Africa – one in Egypt and one in Algeria. Nigeria confirmed its first case of coronavirus and the first in sub-Saharan Africa in Lagos on Feb. 28, The New York Times reported.

Verdict: False The image only counts individuals killed in combat. Data from the Department of Defense (DOD) shows casualties – killed and wounded – for the conflicts were much higher. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image, shared by the Prepare to Take America Back page, claims to show the number of American casualties suffered in some major U.S. conflicts: the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom/Enduring Freedom. However, it appears to only count those killed in combat as casualties, despite the term “casualty” having a broader definition. (RELATED: Did The Military Get Its Biggest Pay Raise In Almost 10 Years?) “Casualties when used in military terms always means killed and wounded,” Yale University history professor Mark Peterson told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email. “The wounded in most cases can no longer fight, so are just as much a loss to the military effort as the killed. And the wounded usually bring long term social costs of care for and loss of productivity from the disabled.” The DOD defines a casualty as “any person who is lost to the organization by having been declared dead, duty status – whereabouts unknown, missing, ill, or injured.” Merriam-Webster offers a similar definition for the term.  While the post’s numbers do match up with the number of “battle deaths” listed for each conflict on a Department of Veteran Affairs fact sheet, they only represent a fraction of the total casualties actually suffered. According to historical data from the DOD’s Defense Casualty Analysis System, here are accurate casualty figures – deaths and wounded in action – for each conflict:  American Revolution: 10,623  War of 1812: 6,765  World War I: 320,518  World War II: 1,076,245  Korean War: 139,858  Vietnam War: 361,864  Desert Shield/Desert Storm: 849  Iraqi Freedom/Enduring Freedom: 58,909 It is important to note that these figures do not include ill service members who would be considered casualties under the DOD’s definition, so it’s possible that the casualty figures for each conflict may actually be higher. (RELATED: Did Kamala Harris Say, ‘Our Military Are Soulless Cowards’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The image does not include other major conflicts, such as the Civil War, Mexican-American War and Spanish-American War.

Congress has not voted to alter or deny the adjustment for 2020. There hasn’t been a change in congressional salaries since 2009. Fact Check: The Social Security Administration (SSA) distributes benefits, among them disability insurance, to well over 60 million Americans each month, using annual cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) to prevent value erosion from inflation.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Since 1975, Congress hasn’t had input in COLAs. The adjustments are automatically made each year based on the change in consumer prices for a basket of goods and services purchased by urban wage earners and clerical workers. Benefits go up if there is a measurable percent increase in the index year over year. There also haven’t been any recent votes to alter or deny Social Security COLAs in either chamber of Congress. The SSA announced a 1.6 percent COLA for 2020. The post’s claim that Congress approved an $8,872 increase in its own monthly salaries doesn’t hold up either. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Divert $2.4 Billion From Social Security To Pay For Impeachment?) In 1989, Congress passed a law authorizing automatic yearly salary adjustments based on changes in private sector wages. Under that law, congressional salaries go up if there is a measurable increase in the Employment Cost Index year over year, unless the adjustment is statutorily denied.  Congress hasn’t seen a salary increase since 2009, when they first instituted the pay freeze. Non-ranking members of the House and Senate currently receive an annual salary of $174,000, and ranking members earn higher salaries – House Speaker receives $223,500, Senate president pro tempore receives $193,400 and majority and minority leaders in both chambers receive $193,400.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/David.Kellum/posts/10221292403077544,https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2019/5a.html,https://www.ssa.gov/news/cola/,https://www.ssa.gov/history/Nixon72.html,https://www.ssa.gov/cola/,https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm,https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/vote_menu_116_1.htm,http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2019/index.asp,http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/index.asp,https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/2019/#10-2019-1,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/01/30/fact-check-nancy-pelosi-divert-billions-social-security-impeachment/,https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Authorizing%20Legislation%20and%20Oversight/6FED47DB4CB9B89585257F1C00752BC7/%24FILE/PL101-194.pdf,https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Authorizing%20Legislation%20and%20Oversight/6FED47DB4CB9B89585257F1C00752BC7/%24FILE/PL101-194.pdf,https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/ncs/concepts.htm,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/congressional-pay-2012_n_2197555,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/97-1011,https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/senate_salaries.htm,https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/salaries,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#21555344574e53614540484d5842404d4d44530f424e4c","Did Congress Deny A $336 Increase In Social Security But Approve An $8,872 Increase In Its Salaries?",,,,,

Fact Check: The quote has cropped up online over the past few years, with this particular post claiming that Obama made the statement equating the American Dream to Trump in 1991. (RELATED: Did Obama’s Portrait Fall Off The Wall During The Unveiling Of Trump’s Portrait At The Colorado Capitol?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But there’s no evidence that Obama ever said or wrote the exact statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. In fact, an internet search revealed that credible online sources have reported on the quote in order to debunk it. The former president and schoolmate Robert Fisher did co-write a paper for a Harvard Law class in April 1991 that mentions Trump. An excerpt from that unpublished paper appeared in author David Garrow’s 2017 book “Rising Star: The Making of Barack Obama.” Here’s the relevant excerpt from Obama and Fisher’s unpublished paper, per The Hill: [Americans have] a continuing normative commitment to the ideals of individual freedom and mobility, values that extend beyond the issue of race in the American mind. The depth of this commitment may be summarily dismissed as the unfounded optimism of the average American – I may not be Donald Trump now, but just you wait; if I don’t make it, my children will. The reference to Trump, Snopes noted, was not an example of the American dream but rather an example of the “unfounded optimism of the average American.” The paper overall argued black Americans should “shift away from rights rhetoric and toward the language of opportunity,” according to Snopes.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The story appears to reference the singer’s 2018 bacterial infection. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The claim has been making the rounds on social media recently, but this particular post links to a Feb. 24 article from the website American Web Media that claims Jones had to cancel some upcoming 2020 shows for health reasons. The article said that the “She’s a Lady” singer had to cancel them after being hospitalized with a bacterial infection. (RELATED: No, TMZ Didn’t Tweet About A Lizzo Concert That Turned Deadly After A Stage Dive) “It is with regret that we have to postpone Tom Jones’ performance at Chester Racecourse this evening,” the article quotes his official account as tweeting. “The show will be rescheduled for Sunday, 12th August. All tickets will remain valid for the rescheduled date.” However, the Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports about Jones recently being hospitalized or cancelling shows. A search of his official website turned up no interruptions in his tour schedule.  Jones actually tweeted the statement quoted in the article on July 19, 2018, after the singer was taken to the hospital with a bacterial infection, forcing him to cancel some shows in the U.K, according to MSN. The story appears to reference that 2018 hospitalization but falsely portrays it as a recent event.

Bernie Sanders received 3,444 votes in the Nevada Democratic caucuses.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Sanders received a total of 6,788 county convention delegates (CCDs) and 41,075 final alignment votes. Fact Check: Sanders emerged as the winner of the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 22, with 6,788 CCDs and 41,075 final alignment votes, according to The New York Times. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Young Bernie Sanders At The Stonewall Riots?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The number of CCDs a Democratic candidate receives determines the number of pledged national delegates the candidate gets from that state at the national convention, according to the Washington Post. Sanders received 24 of Nevada’s 36 national delegates. The victory, The Associated Press noted, cemented his front-runner status among a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates. Behind him, former Vice President Joe Biden received 2,927 CCDs and 19,179 final alignment votes and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg received 2,073 CCDs and 17,598 final alignment votes, according to The New York Times. Sanders previously beat out Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, along with the other presidential hopefuls, in the New Hampshire primary. He came in second place for delegates at Iowa’s first-in-the-nation caucuses Feb. 3, per CNN.

Mattel’s most recent line does not include a Barbie doll that wears a hijab. Fact Check: Featured in the photo is what appears to be a Barbie doll wearing a pale blue headscarf. The Facebook post includes a link to a Feb. 16 article alleging that Mattel modeled the pictured doll after Olympic medal winning fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Mattel just released a new Barbie and some people are simply furious,” reads the caption. “Take a look and decide for yourself if it’s worthy of the controversy.” However, the pictured doll is not the Barbie modeled after Muhammad, nor is it in the company’s latest product release. (RELATED: Viral Image Links Rashida Tlaib’s Scarf To The ‘Islamic Terrorist State’) The hijab-wearing Barbie actually comes from an Instagram account called Hijarbie. Nigerian medical student Haneefa Adam created the account several years ago and shared photos of Barbies dressed in hijabs and other clothing that she made herself, according to CNN.

A review of that product line turned up no dolls wearing hijabs. Mattel started selling its only hijab-wearing Barbie – modeled after Muhammad – in 2018, according to The Associated Press.

It originated on a satire website. Fact Check: The screen grab of another Facebook post shows a link to an article from the website Underground Science. That article, posted Dec. 20, 2016, alleges that researchers at North Carolina State University produced the “first fully living dinosaur embryo in millions of years” using the DNA of chickens, which are modern relatives of the T. rex.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “The living embryo is not a 100 percent dinosaur, but instead a genetically modified hybrid between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a chicken,” it claims, citing a supposed molecular biologist employed at the university. But the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences denied the article’s claim in an April 2016 press release. (RELATED: Did Egyptian Scientists Find That Vaccines Cause Autism?) “A recent ‘news story’ falsely reports an account of the recreation of a Tyrannosaurus rex embryo in the Paleontology Research Lab of the NC Museum of Natural Sciences,” the statement says. “This story is a complete fabrication and the personnel cited in the report are, as far as we can tell, made up.” Included in the museum’s statement is a NC State University News article discussing the limitations of recovering dinosaur DNA from fossils:  Scientists have proposed that DNA has a pretty short shelf-life, most saying that it is unlikely to persist as long as a million years, and surely not more than five or six million years at most. That sort of leaves out the possibility that we will ever obtain it from dinosaurs that last walked the earth over 65 million years ago! The article appears to have originated on World News Daily Report, a parody news website that describes its content as “satirical” and “fictional.” While World News Daily Report clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, Underground Science and other websites have portrayed it as real news.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Ghanaian website Adepa News published an article Feb. 25 alleging the former heavyweight boxing champion is willing to pay $10 million to any man who marries his daughter. Several photos of Tyson posing with a young woman accompany the story.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “After becoming famous, Tyson has been favored by many beautiful women, with three marriages and many children of his own.

In order to find her a boyfriend, Tyson proposed 10 million dollars for her daughter’s marriage.” But, contrary to the article, Tyson has not made such a proposal. The Daily Caller didn’t find any credible media outlets reporting Tyson offered men $10 million to marry his daughter. His publicist, Joann Mignano, not only told the Caller in an email that the claim was “false,” but she also confirmed Tyson does not have a daughter named Mitchell. “There is absolutely no truth to this,” Mignano said. “No daughter named Mitchell.” (RELATED: Did Muhammad Ali Say This Quote About The ‘Impossible’?)

Fact Check: Trump promised early in his 2016 campaign that he would refuse the annual $400,000 presidential salary afforded to him under federal law – and he appears to have stuck by that promise. The image, originally posted on the social media website Parler, alleges the president recently donated his $400,000 salary for the rebuilding of military cemeteries.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Yet, while the president has contributed his salary to various government initiatives, including some military-related projects, none of these donations paid for cemetery repairs. He has never given a single agency his entire yearly salary, per FactCheck.org. (RELATED: Is Donald Trump The Only President Since George Washington To Donate His Salary?) In 2017, Trump donated his first-quarter salary to the National Park Service. The Department of the Interior announced in a July 2017 statement that it would fund restoration projects at Maryland’s Antietam National Battlefield. Those funds, however, did not go toward the Antietam National Cemetery, according to a spokesperson from the Interior Department. “The funds were used to rebuild the historic fence line important to the battle and rehabilitate the exterior of the historic Newcomer House,” the spokesperson told the Daily Caller in an email. “None of the money was used in the cemetery.” According to White House announcements, his other 2017 quarterly salary donations went to the Department of Education for a student science camp, the Department of Health and Human Services for the opioid crisis and Department of Transportation for infrastructure, respectively.  In 2018, Trump donated his first-quarter salary to the Department of Veteran Affairs for caregiving programs, according to The Hill. The Small Business Administration and National Institutes of Health were the recipients of his second- and third-quarter salaries, USA Today reported.

It’s actually a photoshopped screen grab of a real 2016 tweet about flag burning. Fact Check: The screen grab of Trump’s alleged tweet suggesting punishment for people who photoshop “unflattering” images of him resurfaced in February. It comes after a doctored photo appearing to show the president having a dark tan line on his face went viral earlier this month.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is, however, no evidence Trump ever tweeting that statement. A search of Trump’s official Twitter accounts turned up no similar or matching tweets. ProPublica’s archive of the president’s deleted tweets doesn’t have a record of it on Nov. 29, 2016, or any other date. Through a review of Trump’s @realDonaldTrump timeline, the Daily Caller discovered that it is actually a digitally altered version of a real tweet.

Verdict: False  Officials said that there are “no indications” enemy fire brought down the military plane that crashed in late January and that Taliban claims of shooting down the helicopter are “false.” The Daily Caller News Foundation found no reports of 34 soldiers being killed in one day that month. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The story, originally posted on the Russian website Fort Russ News, alleges that the Taliban took responsibility for a downed Air Force jet in the Taliban-controlled Ghazni province and also shot down a “transport helicopter dispatched to the site of the downed US Air Force jet.” As many as 34 American soldiers were killed in that one day, it said, citing Taliban sources and the Russian blog Avia.pro. Col. Sonny Leggett, the official spokesperson for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, confirmed on Twitter Jan. 27 that an Air Force plane did crash in the Ghazni province but said there was “no indication that it was brought down by enemy fire.” The bodies of the two crew members on board were later recovered from the crash site, The New York Times reported.  A U.S. Bombardier E-11A crashed today in Ghazni province, Afghanistan. While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire. We will provide additional information as it becomes available. — USFOR-A Spokesman Col Sonny Leggett (@USFOR_A) January 27, 2020  Fort Russ News reported that the Taliban took credit for bringing down the Bombardier E-11A, but different sources within the group appear to contradict one another. Zabihullah Mujahid, an official Taliban spokesman, told The Washington Post and other outlets the plane had been shot down, while a statement from the Taliban’s website simply said the plane “crashed.” The article’s claims that the Taliban shot down a helicopter en route to the crash site and killed more than 30 American servicemen don’t hold up either. (RELATED: Do The Taliban Control Nearly 45 Percent Of Afghanistan?)  News organizations often report on the deaths of the American soldiers in Afghanistan. If as many as 34 members of the U.S. military had been killed in such a short timespan, it would have been covered by the media, yet no outlets have reported on it. Nor did the DCNF find any media reports or about the Taliban shooting down a U.S. helicopter in late January. In fact, Leggett debunked that allegation in a Jan. 27 tweet.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   Taliban claims that additional aircraft have crashed are false. — USFOR-A Spokesman Col Sonny Leggett (@USFOR_A) January 27, 2020   “Taliban claims that additional aircraft have crashed are false,” he wrote.

The images have been photoshopped or taken out of context. A satire website originally published the claim.

She set the record after giving birth to octuplets in 2009, according to the Guinness World Records website. Images included in the post appear to be photoshopped or taken out of context, further adding to the post’s dubiousness.

Bernie Sanders at the 1969 Stonewall riots.               View this post on Instagram                         A post shared by Indie Sauce (@indiesauce) on Feb 14, 2020 at 8:47am PST     googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The photo doesn’t appear to resemble any archival images of the Stonewall riots. A spokesman for the Sanders campaign confirmed the young man in the photo is not the Vermont senator. Fact Check: Shortly after Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, a black-and-white photo of four women and a man standing up against a wall started circulating widely on Instagram and Twitter, with some users alleging the man wearing the black turtleneck is “Bernie Sanders at the stonewall (sic) riots.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Stonewall uprising occurred following a June 28, 1969, police raid that targeted gay patrons at the Stonewall Inn in New York City. The riots are widely considered a catalyst for the modern LGBTQ rights movement. The image, however, doesn’t resemble any archival photos of the 1969 Stonewall uprising available online. Social media users have used a colorized version of the image to poke fun at hipsters and Tumblr users since at least December 2014, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. Mike Casca, a campaign spokesman for Sanders, told The Associated Press that the Vermont senator isn’t pictured. (RELATED: Did Bernie Sanders Say The US Has ‘Had Enough With White Men In Places Of Power’?) Sanders has publicly supported gay rights in the past. For instance, the Vermont Senator spoke against the controversial “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, which permitted gay and lesbian Americans to serve in the military as long as they hid their sexualities, and the Defense of Marriage Act, which proposed defining marriage as between a man and a woman, according to The New York Times.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

That bible verse, per the King James Version, reads, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” The fast food chain prints various Bible verses on its cups, burger wrappers and fry boats, among other packaging. For instance, the wrappers on the chain’s popular “Double-Double” sandwiches feature Nahum 1:7, according to Snopes. In-N-Out Burger isn’t the only fast food chain that’s been the target of misinformation on social media. Burger King appeared recently in a misleading article on Facebook that falsely claimed the restaurant chain used horse meat.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Mulroney and her husband have both denied the claim as well. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });     Markle and Prince Harry announced in early January that they intend to “step back” as senior members of Britain’s royal family and seek financial independence. (RELATED: Does This Picture Show Meghan Markle With George Soros’ Son?) The couple said the move would allow them to “raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the face to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.” The new charitable entity will not utilize the name “Sussex Royal” any other iteration of “Royal,” per their spring 2020 transition plan. A viral image, posted Feb. 23, alleged that Mulroney, a stylist and close friend of Markle, registered the website sussexglobalcharities.com on the couple’s behalf through the charity Shoebox Project Foundation, along with a screen grab of the domain’s registration. Mulroney denied registering the domain on Twitter, after the Daily Mail first published a report Feb. 22 claiming she had. Her husband, Ben, also called the claim “false.”   If certain investigative journalists were to do their jobs, perhaps they would see that Shoebox Project Foundation is owned by a Mr Roy in North Carolina and has no affiliations or ties to our charity The Shoebox Project.

Verdict: False The head of medical virology at Stellenbosch University debunked the claim in an interview with Agence France-Presse (AFP). Scientists have suggested it may have originated in bats, but the exact source of the outbreak is still unknown. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Misinformation about the novel respiratory virus, known as COVID-19, has spread widely across social media. In this case, a viral Facebook post alleges the use of rhino horns “possibly” caused the coronavirus outbreak. “There are a lot of myths like the ones you refer to currently circulating,” World Health Organization (WHO) spokeswoman Margaret Harris told the Daily Caller. “We call it an ‘infodemic.'” Wolfgang Preiser, the head of medical virology at Stellenbosch University, told AFP that the virus couldn’t have come from a rhino horn. (RELATED: No, The WHO Did Not Officially Designate Coronavirus As A Plague) “Viruses need live cells, live organisms for themselves to replicate, so even the rhino horn as such, even if it’s still on the rhino, would not be able to be infected with the virus because the rhino horn is dead,” Preiser told AFP.  The outbreak’s exact source remains unknown, but health officials believe it may have originated in a seafood and live animal market located in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the Wall Street Journal reported. The virus, the Centers for Disease Control website explains, comes from the same family of betacoronaviruses as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which both have origins in bats. Scientists suggest the novel coronavirus may also have originated in bats and gotten transmitted to humans through an intermediary host species, according to Business Insider.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The WHO reports a total of 78,811 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been found globally, with 77,042 documented in China and 1,769 documented in 28 other countries, as of Feb. 23.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It appears to be a distortion of an August 2017 post Schumer published on Medium. Fact Check:  Schumer has been the subject of viral misinformation on several occasions. In this case, a viral Maga2020 News article attempts to paint him in a negative light by suggesting he said it was racist to only allow U.S. citizens to vote.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But, contrary to the article, there is no evidence the Senate minority leader ever made the statement featured in the headline. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any instance of Schumer saying these words in the congressional record, social media or public statements. Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer, confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the Senate minority leader “has not said this.” (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say, ‘It Is Dangerous To Let The Voters Decide Trump’s Fate’?) The quote, previously debunked by PolitiFact and FactCheck.org, has been circulating online since at least 2017. It appears to distort what Schumer wrote in an Aug. 24, 2017, Medium post about President Donald Trump’s now-dissolved Election Integrity Commission, which was established in May 2017 to address “improper voter registrations, improper voting, fraudulent voter registrations, and fraudulent voting.” In the Medium post, Schumer described the commission as an “effort to intimidate voters and purge them from the rolls through a national voter database of personal information” that disenfranchises minority voters. He also called for its dissolution and public hearings about voting rights. (Trump dissolved the commission in January 2018, citing a lack of cooperation from various states.)  Nowhere in the Medium post does Schumer make the statement attributed to him in the Maga2020 News headline, nor does he express support for the idea that noncitizens should be allowed to vote in U.S. elections.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image, posted by UberFacts on Feb. 17, likely references an April 2017 missile test conducted by North Korea, though the post appears to get details of that failed flight test wrong. (RELATED: Did North Korea Test Missiles Every 24 Days Under Obama?) North Korea conducted a flight test of a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) on April 28, 2017, The Diplomat reported. It flew approximately 24 miles before crashing into a complex of industrial and agricultural buildings in Tokchon, a city north of the capital city of Pyongyang, according to the magazine. If the country had “accidentally nuked” one of its own cities, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets reported the missile had a nuclear payload. U.S. officials actually told NBC News that the ballistic missile was non-nuclear, according to CNBC. The Center for Strategic and International Studies reports that North Korea has launched six Hwasong-12 IRBMs since April 2017. Three tests involved missiles capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilograms (1,102.31 pounds) a distance of at least 300 kilometers (186.4 miles), per the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies database.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The Nevada Democratic Party did hire an ex-Buttigieg staffer as its voter protection director but, according to multiple media reports and statements from party and campaign spokespeople, she will not lead voter protection efforts in the caucuses. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Nevada Democratic Party hired Emily Goldman as its voter protection director in January, the Las Vegas Sun reported. Screenshots of Goldman’s LinkedIn profile show she worked as an Iowa organizer for Buttigieg’s campaign until February, when she appears to have started her new voter protection director role with the party, according to Fox5. Concerns among voters quickly spread on social media, and some news outlets covered the Nevada Democratic Party’s hiring decision. The website Blavity published a report Feb. 11 with the headline claiming, “Former Staffer For Pete Buttigieg’s Campaign Is Now In Charge Of Voter Protection For Nevada Caucus.” But that headline is inaccurate.

Everyone working at NV Dems now has the same job: executing the most transparent, accessible, and expansive caucus yet.” Fox5 and the Las Vegas Review-Journal also both reported that Goldman’s primary role will be assisting the party ahead of the general election in November.

Verdict: False Obama pardoned 212 people, and Trump has pardoned 25 so far, Justice Department (DOJ) data shows. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    On Feb. 18, Trump granted clemency to 11 individuals, pardoning former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. and commuting the 14-year sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, among others, The New York Times reported. Pardons remove all legal consequences of criminal convictions, whereas commutations totally or partially reduce an individual’s sentence while leaving the conviction intact, according to the DOJ. Comparisons between the president’s pardoning record and Obama’s started circulating online shortly after Trump’s most recent clemency blitz. The Liberal Privilege USA page alleged Obama pardoned 1,927 people, whereas Trump only pardoned 26, commenting, “And Trump is abusing that power?” But clemency statistics compiled by the DOJ show those figures are inaccurate. (RELATED: Viral Instagram Post Claims MLK Didn’t Die From A Gunshot)  The post likely got its figure for Obama from his total 1,927 grants of clemency. That number includes 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations, including 330 that he granted on his last day in office, per the DOJ. Obama has granted more clemency than any other president since Harry Truman, according to the Pew Research Center. ﻿﻿ Meanwhile, Trump has granted clemency to 35 individuals to date. Those clemencies include 25 pardons and 10 commutations, according to DOJ clemency statistics. (It is important to note, however, that the post’s comparison of the two presidents’ records isn’t “apples-to-apples,” as the figures cover Obama’s two terms of office and the first roughly three years of Trump’s presidential term, respectively.)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The White House has assembled a team of advisers to recommend and vet candidates for future pardons and commutations, the Washington Post reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Polling data shows only a minority of Americans in any age group believe the moon landing never happened. Fact Check:  On July 20, 1969, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the surface of the moon. (RELATED: Did NASA’s Cassini Spacecraft Take This Picture Of Saturn?) The conspiracy theory that the 1969 moon landing never happened has existed for over 50 years. Social media websites have given conspiracy theorists platforms to advance their views, with one Instagram page claiming, “To this day, 89 percent of Americans, under the age of 45, believe we never went to the moon.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    But belief in this theory is not nearly as pervasive as the Instagram post suggests. Polls about the moon landing have consistently shown only a minority of Americans in all age groups believe it never happened. Polls conducted on the conspiracy theory in the 90s show that, overall, only a small percentage of Americans believe the government faked the moon landing. One conducted by Gallup in 1999 found that only six percent believe the conspiracy theory. That percentage was the exact same as a Time/CNN survey done four years prior, according to Gallup. Ipsos polled the issue in 2019, the year of the moon landing’s 50th anniversary, and found that only six percent of all respondents believed it was staged. Among millennials, who are under the age of 45, 11 percent indicated their belief in the conspiracy theory. That percentage is slightly higher than those of Generation X respondents (six percent) and Baby Boomer respondents (three percent), according to the polling data. Another 2019 poll, conducted by YouGov, found that 29 percent of respondents 50 years old or younger expressed some belief that the U.S. government “faked the 1969 Apollo moon landing,” with eight percent answering “definitely true” and 21 percent answering “probably true.” Among respondents over the age of 50, only one percent answered “definitely true” and nine percent answered “probably true,” according to the poll.  The DCNF found no polls supporting the post’s claim that 89 percent of Americans under the age of 45 believe the moon landing never occurred. We rate this claim false.

(RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A New York Times Article About Nevada Primary Polls) “A local teen, Peter Buttigieg, has been arrested on suspicion of the recent killings of at least 5 dogs,” the alleged article reports. “Authorities say they were able to locate the suspected individual thanks to testimony of witnesses who saw the teen allegedly strangling a stray dog.” The South Bend Tribune published a report Feb. 11 debunking the article as fake. The “bogus” article had several editorial and stylistic discrepancies that gave it away, including not having byline, dateline, or age or hometown for Buttigieg, according to the South Bend Tribune. “The Tribune would not have named anyone ‘arrested on suspicion’ of the crimes in question before that person was charged,” wrote the South Bend Tribune. “That’s especially true of a 16-year-old, Buttigieg’s age on that date.”  Alan Achkar, the newspaper’s executive editor, shared the real front page of the newspaper published Aug. 30, 1998, on his Twitter.

Only U.S. citizens residing in Chicago can use them to register and vote in local, state and federal elections conducted by the city’s Board of Election Commissioners. Fact Check: The CityKey program officially started in April 2018, roughly a year after Chicago’s city council passed the ordinance authorizing the optional IDs that function as a form of government ID, transit card and library card. They are available to all Chicago residents, regardless of immigration status.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral image alleges these CityKey IDs “allow illegal immigrants to vote in local, state & federal elections.” It has been shared more than 3,600 times since being posted. Contrary to the post’s claim, noncitizens cannot use these municipal IDs to vote in local, state or federal elections conducted by the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, per a March 2018 statement. Only Chicago residents who meet the registration requirements, including having U.S. citizenship and being at least 18 years old, can use them to vote. Kate LeFurgy, a spokeswoman for Chicago City Clerk Anna Valencia, confirmed to the Daily Caller that non-U.S. citizens cannot use CityKey ID cards to register to vote. (RELATED: More Than 2 Months Into 2019 – Are Murders Down In Chicago?) “Only people who meet the qualifications to register to vote such as age and residency are eligible to vote,” LeFurgy said in an email. “The CityKey is one of my documents that voters who meet those qualifications can use to register to vote, including a library card and FOID card among many others.”  While noncitizens are barred from voting in local, state and federal elections conducted by the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners, they can vote in Local School Council elections if they are the parents or legal guardians of children attending Chicago public schools. Noncitizen parents in Chicago have been permitted to do so since 1988, according to the Migration Policy Institute.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215549796206957&set=a.4302092039455&type=3&theater,http://www.chicityclerk.com/chicagocitykey/about,http://www.chicityclerk.com/news/city-clerk-valencia-and-mayor-emanuel-officially-launch-chicago-citykey-program,https://chicago.councilmatic.org/legislation/o2017-1950/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10215549796206957&set=a.4302092039455&type=3&theater,https://chicityclerk.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/CityKey%20RFP%20QA%202.28.18%20Final.pdf,https://app.chicagoelections.com/documents/general/Statement-Regarding-Voter-Registration-IDs.pdf,https://chicagoelections.gov/en/register-to-vote-change-of-address.html,https://www.linkedin.com/in/katelefurgy,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/03/14/fact-check-murders-chicago-2019/,https://www.newsweek.com/immigrants-are-getting-right-vote-cities-across-america-664467,https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5871061e6b8f5b2a8ede8ff5/t/5acce55f0e2e72f4e50d9877/1523377505203/2018+LSC+Elections+Infographic+final.pdf,https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/immigrant-voting-rights-receive-more-attention,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#85f1f7e0f3eaf7c5e1e4ece9fce6e4e9e9e0f7abe6eae8","Can Noncitizens Use Chicago’s CityKey IDs To Vote In Local, State And Federal Elections?",,,,,

Verdict: False Obama has not endorsed Bloomberg or any other 2020 presidential candidate to date. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Bloomberg’s campaign recently put out an advertisement that highlights the former New York City mayor’s past work with Obama on issues such as gun safety, education and youth employment. WATCH:  Several Obama administration officials, the New York Post noted, pushed back on the ad’s portrayal of Bloomberg and Obama’s relationship. For instance, former National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor tweeted, “It’s jarring to see all these Bloomberg ads suggest Obama has endorsed him, especially considering how… perfunctory his endorsement of Obama was back in 2012.”  One viral Facebook post, which has been shared more than 1,800 times, claims that Obama has formally endorsed Bloomberg, appearing to reference the fact that Obama has not endorsed his former vice president, Joe Biden, who is also vying for the Democratic presidential nomination. (Biden has said he asked Obama not to endorse his campaign.) But the post’s claim that Obama endorsed Bloomberg’s bid for the White House doesn’t hold up. (RELATED: Do 2,900 Children Die From Gun Violence Every Year?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Endorsements of presidential candidates frequently make national headlines. If Obama had endorsed Bloomberg for president, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it, and neither has issued a press release. Obama has not formally endorsed any Democratic candidates to date in the 2020 election cycle, according to Politico.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Health officials believe the coronavirus outbreak may have originated in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, according to the Wall Street Journal. Cases of the novel respiratory virus have now been confirmed in at least 25 countries as of Feb. 18, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports. A viral post alleges its video footage, which features live and dead animals being sold in close proximity to each other, depicts that Wuhan market. It has been viewed more than 15,100 times since being posted on Jan. 28. However, the market captured in the video is not located in Wuhan or any other Chinese city, contrary to the post’s claim. It actually shows the Langowan market located in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. At the beginning of the video, a title card that roughly translates to “Langowan EXTREME Market” reveals the true location of the market. A sign visible in the video also reads “Langowan Market Office” when translated to English, according to The Associated Press.  The footage dates back to at least July 2019, when it was posted on YouTube with the description saying, “The most extreme food in the world is only in Langowan Market.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Chinese Coronavirus Hospital In Wuhan) China has reported 72,528 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 1,870 deaths to the WHO at the time of publication.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1064517710549007,https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-know-about-the-wuhan-virus-11579716128,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200218-sitrep-29-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=6262de9e_2,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1064517710549007,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7962925/Disturbing-footage-shows-snakes-bats-possums-sold-openly-Wuhan-market.html,https://apnews.com/0ad1e8be56e040b4ab0e85c3d13c3358,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDvXy6YlPOc&feature=emb_title,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/02/07/fact-check-image-coronavirus-hospital-wuhan/,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200218-sitrep-29-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=6262de9e_2,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfbbbdaab9a0bd8fabaea6a3b6acaea3a3aabde1aca0a2",Does This Video Show The Market Where The Coronavirus Outbreak Originated?,,,,,

[Screenshot/Facebook]Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has not confirmed any cases of coronavirus in Tennessee. The website has previously published misinformation about coronavirus cases in other U.S. cities. Fact Check: As of Feb. 17, the CDC has identified 15 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19, in seven states. That number nearly doubled after 14 American cruise ship passengers who tested positive for coronavirus were flown back to the U.S. from Japan later the same day, The New York Times reported. CBTVN.com published an article titled “BREAKING NEWS: Eight test positive for coronavirus in Nashville,” citing the unspecified authorities. Multiple users have shared it on Facebook in recent days.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Seven Americans and one Chinese (sic) have tested positive for coronavirus in Nashville, TN, authorities have said in a statement,” claims the article. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Chinese Coronavirus Hospital In Wuhan) There have, however, been no confirmed cases of the novel respiratory virus in Tennessee to date. The seven states that have documented cases of COVID-19 include Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Illinois, Texas, Arizona, Washington and California, per the CDC website. Jeannie Hopland, an East Tennessee woman who was quarantined on the Princess Diamond cruise ship off the coast of Japan, did test positive for coronavirus, according to Memphis affiliate WVLT, but she and her husband, Arnold, have not yet returned to the U.S. at the time of publication. CBTVN.com, which attempts to pose as Newsweek on its front page, has previously posted fake news articles about coronavirus cases in other U.S. cities, including Billings, Montana, and Wilmington, North Carolina.  The nearly identical article about Nashville is the website’s latest example of misinformation related to coronavirus.

Fact Check: The results of Feb. 3’s Iowa caucuses were delayed after problems related to a “coding issue” in the phone app Democrats hoped would simplify the counting and reporting of votes, ABC News reported. Shadow Inc., a technology firm owned by campaign consulting nonprofit ACRONYM, created the app.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Some social media users have claimed Buttigieg owns Shadow Inc., while others alleged that the Indiana mayor either funded or created the app that caused a major delay in Iowa voting results. “So Pete Buttigieg won Iowa???” wrote one user. “He owns a company that owns the app they used to count votes and Pete Buttigieg won?” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A New York Times Article About Nevada Primary Polls) The claim, however, is false. Campaign finance records reveal Buttigieg’s campaign paid the firm $21,250 in July for “software rights and subscriptions” that were not developed specifically for the Iowa caucuses. Buttigieg and his husband, Chasten, do not appear to have any ownership stake in Shadow Inc., per his financial disclosure forms. “A presidential candidate is required to disclose all assets and spousal assets, including stock, on their financial disclosure form,” explained Brendan Fischer, the federal reform director at the nonpartisan watchdog group Campaign Legal Center, in an email to the Daily Caller. “I suspect that passing connections between Buttigieg’s campaign and Shadow have been spun into a conspiracy on social media.”  Buttigieg’s campaign did not help develop the app, a campaign spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press. Other presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, and Democratic parties, like Texas Democratic Party, have previously paid Shadow Inc. for similar services, according to Federal Election Commission filings.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The Iowa Democratic Party began a partial recanvass of the state’s precinct results at the request of the Sanders and Buttigieg campaigns over the weekend, CNN reported.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

There are no vaccines or specific treatments for the respiratory illness, per the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) websites. Fact Check: The WHO reported that, as of Feb. 16, there have been 51,857 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, with 1,666 deaths in China and 3 in other countries. The virus, known as COVID-19, is believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    An image, which features a screen grab of an alleged news broadcast and a still from the 1994 film “Pulp Fiction,” claims cocaine “kills” the novel respiratory virus.

Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson, told the Caller on Feb. 8 that “there is no known cure at this point.” Nor does any specific treatment for COVID-19 exist, according to the CDC.  The Caller debunked a similar news chyron alleging that marijuana “kills” coronavirus earlier this month.

The original story, published Jan. 13, detailed a December 2018 meeting between Sanders and Massachusetts Sen.

The claim originated on a satire website. Fact Check: The image falsely alleges in a post that a trend called “red lighting,” in which people install red bulbs in their porch lights to indicate gun-free zones, has become popular among activists who oppose guns. It then encourages Facebook users to like and share the post if they disagree with the tactic.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “A Gun Free Safe Home is everything America is supposed to be,” the post quotes someone named Jane Seymore as saying. (RELATED: Are Most Gun Crimes Committed With Handguns?) There is, however, no evidence that people opposed to guns are using red porch lights to signal that their homes are gun-free. The Daily Caller searched the internet and news coverage for such a trend but only found media outlets debunking it. The claim appears to have originated on ImmediateSafety.org, where a 2015 article described the same “red lighting” trend and quoted Seymore, a director at the nonexistent Department of Protecting Everyone. Though the website doesn’t describe its articles as satirical or fake, the headlines of other stories posted on it indicate that its content is indeed fictional. Those headlines include “Google Driverless Car Flips Off Asia Woman Driver” and “Donald Trump Replaces George Washington Painting In The Oval Office With Vigo The Carpathian.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A post shared by  Anthony B (@anthony_b_originalfireman) on Feb 3, 2020 at 2:45pm PST   Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  There is no known cure for the coronavirus. Nor is there a specific treatment for the viral respiratory illness. Fact Check: As of Feb. 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 45,171 confirmed cases of the novel respiratory virus, with 44,730 of those cases in China and 441 in other countries. The coronavirus, which has killed some 1,115 people, is believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The post features an alleged screen grab of a chyron from a live news broadcast, saying, “Breaking News: Weed Kills Corona Virus.” Scientists were shocked by the discovery, a ticker beneath the headline claims.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports that scientists have discovered marijuana can cure or treat the novel coronavirus. The screen grab appears to have been made on one of the many websites that allow people to create their own breaking news chyrons. The bud photo can be found on a stock image website. Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson, told the Caller “there is no known cure at this point.” Nor does a specific treatment for the novel coronavirus exist, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In fact, the WHO website states taking supplements and smoking are ineffective and can even be harmful when used as remedies for coronavirus. Chinese scientists are currently testing antiviral drugs against the new coronavirus, according to Reuters.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Missouri-based Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 31-20 to claim their first Super Bowl title in 50 years earlier this month. President Donald Trump quickly took to Twitter Feb. 2 to congratulate the Chiefs for the win and for representing the “Great State of Kansas and, in fact, the entire USA,” though he later deleted it and tweeted a corrected version. This viral image pokes fun at Trump’s tweet. Though the t-shirt poking fun at Trump’s erroneous tweet does exist, Mahomes didn’t wear it. The original photo, posted on Twitter by Mahomes’ marketing agent, Jacqueline Dahl, shows the outline of Missouri and the phrase “The Great State of Kansas” were superimposed onto his shirt.

Elizabeth Warren once said, “Having an abortion is no different than someone having their tonsils removed.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence Warren ever made the statement attributed to her in the post, though she has made comparisons between the safety of procedures in the past. Fact Check: Warren has been the subject of viral misinformation on numerous occasions. In this case, a viral post credits the Massachusetts senator with saying a quote equating an abortion to a tonsillectomy. (RELATED: Does Elizabeth Warren Want To Take Guns Away From Republicans?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is, however, no evidence of Warren ever saying or writing the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller searched the internet, social media and news coverage and could not find any instance of her ever making that statement. Yet, while there’s no proof the Massachusetts senator ever made this statement, she has made comparisons between the safety of the two procedures on several occasions in the past. On Jan. 21, 2018, Warren authored an op-ed for Time magazine, in which she wrote, “On the 45th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I think about what has changed since abortions became legal. Our health care system has pretty much dealt with the safety issue: thanks to Roe v. Wade, abortion is now safer than getting your tonsils out. A lot of women are alive today because of Roe.” That opinion column included a link to a 2014 Time magazine article about a study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology. The authors of the study told Time that they observed the rate of complications following abortions was lower that those following wisdom teeth removals and tonsillectomies.  Warren also made a similar statement on the floor of the Senate Jan. 31, 2018, while delivering a speech in opposition to a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. (RELATED: Does The Alabama Abortion Bill Mandate Jail For False Rape Allegations?) Several months later, she wrote an opinion column outlining her objections to President Donald Trump nominating Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court for Marie Claire magazine. She again made a comparison between the safety of the two procedures in that July 2018 op-ed.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “Today, thanks to Roe, getting an abortion is safer than getting your tonsils out,” wrote Warren. “Before Roe v. Wade, many women turned to back-alley butchers to end their pregnancies.” The quote, Snopes reported, stems from websites that publishing articles mischaracterizing her comparison of the safety of the procedures in her arguments supporting Roe v. Wade.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The company operates out of Shanghai, not Wuhan. Resemblance between the two logos appears to be coincidental. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post uses the logos to suggest a connection between a real biological research company and Umbrella Corporation, the fictional lab responsible for a viral outbreak that plays a key role in the plot of the “Resident Evil” video games. “In #ResidentEvil the Umbrella Corporation releases a virus that infects the people of Raccoon City,” reads the post. “A biological research lab with the exact same logo as the Umbrella Corporation can be found in the city where the #CoronaVirus outbreak originated. Corona is an anagram for Racoon (sic).” The viral image provides the location of the real biological research company by showing its name. Shanghai Ruilan Bao Hu San Biotech Limited is based in the Pujiang District of Shanghai, more than 500 miles away from the central city of Wuhan where the novel coronavirus is believed to have originated. Shanghai Ruilan Bao Hu San Biotech Limited offers services such as “accurate health testing consultation, health assessment services, disease prevention and consultation, and health conditioning,” according to a translation of its website.

Researchers and writers of the report confirmed that there is no way to use its findings to calculate such a percentage. Fact Check:  Human Rights Watch, an international non-governmental organization that tracks human rights abuses, released a Feb. 5 report, titled “Deported to Danger: United States Deportation Policies Expose Salvadorans to Death and Abuse,” that outlines some of the dangers faced by Salvadorans who are deported from the U.S. back to El Salvador, which has one of the highest homicide rates in the world.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Numerous media outlets, including NBC News, The Associated Press and the Daily Beast, reported on Human Rights Watch’s findings. (RELATED: Did Trump Terminate Temporary Protected Status For 98 Percent Of Its Recipients?) “A huge percentage of migrants and asylum seekers from El Salvador who were deported by the United States have been killed, raped or tortured after returning home,” wrote the Daily Beast, citing the Human Rights Watch study. But that statement from the Daily Beast misrepresents what the study actually found. Human Rights Watch confirmed through court records, media reports and interviews with family members that 138 Salvadoran deportees had been murdered and more than 70 others had been sexually assaulted or tortured since 2013. A majority of the documented deaths occurred less than a year after the deportees were sent back to El Salvador, according to the report. The U.S. deported 111,000 Salvadorans back to their home country between 2014 and 2018, Human Rights Watch reported. The number of Salvadorans seeking asylum increased by nearly 1,000 percent from 2012 to 2017, with many citing the gang violence prevalent in El Salvador, according to The Associated Press.  While the report does underscore the risks faced by Salvadorans forced to return to their home country, it at no point attempts to calculate the percentage of all Salvadoran deportees harmed, as the Daily Beast appears to suggest. Elizabeth Kennedy, the primary researcher of the Human Rights Watch report, told the Daily Caller News Foundation that such a percentage “cannot be calculated” from the report. (RELATED: Are There 2,000 MS-13 Gang Members On Long Island?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “The only way an accurate percentage could be calculated is for one of the two governments involved to either follow up with all persons returned or with a representative sample of all persons returned for at least several months,” Kennedy explained in an email. “Neither the U.S., El Salvador, nor any of the other 20+ nations who have deported Salvadorans have done this, as our report makes clear in several places.” “We did not purport to provide a percentage of deportees harmed,” said Clara Long, a Human Rights Watch senior researcher who contributed to the writing and editing of the report, in a Twitter direct message to the DCNF.

Every. Single. Day.https://t.co/k1Nre24hUO pic.twitter.com/igVZqYpNrM — Team Bloomberg (@Mike2020) January 30, 2020  Verdict: False  The statistic includes the deaths of 18- and 19-year-olds who are legally considered adults in most U.S. states. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data from 2013 to 2017, the time period used by the Bloomberg campaign, show there was an average of 1,499 gun deaths per year among children between the ages of 0 and 17. Fact Check:  Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York City, has so far spent more than $140 million on TV and digital advertising for his presidential bid, according to The Wall Street Journal. His campaign reportedly paid $10 million to air a 60-second advertisement during the Feb. 2 Super Bowl match-up between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The ad features Calandrian Kemp discussing the death of her son, George Kemp Jr., who was shot and killed outside of Houston in 2013 at age 20. She praises Bloomberg for his efforts to implement more stringent gun control laws. At one point, the ad shows a graphic saying, “2,900 children die from gun violence every year.” That figure, however, is misleading. (RELATED: Did Michael Bloomberg Say Trump is ‘Known Among Other Millionaires As A Con-Artist’?) The statistic appears to come from a 2019 report by Everytown for Gun Safety, a Bloomberg-affiliated gun control nonprofit. It uses CDC data between the years of 2013 and 2017. But as the report clearly states in a June 2019 fact sheet, the figure includes 18- and 19-year-olds legally considered adults in most states, not just those considered children under the law. When looking at the same CDC data for children ages zero through 17, the number of deaths by firearm (intentional and unintentional) drops to 1,499 per year. That figure is roughly 48% lower than the 2,900 deaths in Bloomberg’s ad.  The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and Gifford’s Law Center, both nonprofits that advocate for gun control, reported roughly 1,500 children killed by gun violence per year for the same time period. It’s important to note that both the CDC and Bloomberg campaign’s numbers include suicides, police shootings, accidental shootings and shootings that have an undetermined intent. These instances may or may not be counted depending upon which definition of gun violence is used.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for the Bloomberg campaign, explained the campaign’s decision to include young people legally considered adults in the Super Bowl ad’s figure in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation: “Ask any grieving parent whose 18- or 19-year-old son or daughter was shot and killed, and they will tell you they lost a child,” Wood said. “There are simply too many of these deaths, and Mike has a plan to prevent them with common-sense gun safety laws.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  There’s no record of such a company in California. Aniston’s publicist debunked the claim in an email statement to the Daily Caller. Fact Check: This isn’t the first social media users have made dubious claims about Aniston’s political affiliation. The “Friends” actress appeared last year in a doctored image on Facebook wearing a lewd Biden campaign shirt. “Me and all the Trump supporter celebrities decided to make a company named ‘Celebrities for Trump,’ which fights against all anti Trump celebrities,” a viral post now credits Aniston with saying. “I think President Trump needs our support.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is, however, no evidence of Aniston or any other celebrities starting such a company. The Caller found no record of any corporation or limited liability company called “Celebrities for Trump” registered with the office of the California secretary of state. “The story [in question] is absurd and 100 percent false,” Aniston’s publicist, Stephen Huvane, told the Caller in an email. “Jennifer has never said that statement nor would she ever start any organization that would support Trump.” (RELATED: Did Jennifer Aniston Wear A ‘Handsy’ Joe Biden T-Shirt?) Aniston has supported at least one Democratic candidate this election cycle, making the claim even more dubious. In May 2019, the “Friends” actress donated $250 to South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s campaign, according to Federal Election Commission documents. She has previously contributed $36,100 to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and $30,700 to the Democratic National Committee. The claim, debunked by Snopes in 2017, originated with the headline of an article that combined a story about a Saturday Night Live skit poking fun at Trump and a story about a debunked rumor that Aniston launching a clothing line with the Home Shopping Network.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/Iamnotadictator/photos/a.132484303596519/1153248368186769/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/joanne.bostedocox/posts/10156368660946687,https://www.facebook.com/Iamnotadictator/photos/a.132484303596519/1153248368186769/?type=3&theater,https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?filing=&SearchType=CORP&SearchCriteria=Celebrities+for+Trump&SearchSubType=Keyword,https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/CBS/SearchResults?filing=&SearchType=CORP&SearchCriteria=Celebrities+for+Trump&SearchSubType=Keyword,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/26/fact-check-jennifer-aniston-joe-biden-2020-t-shirt-hands/,https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202001089167029649,https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?contributor_name=Jennifer+Aniston&two_year_transaction_period=2016&min_date=01%2F01%2F2015&max_date=12%2F31%2F2016,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-jennifer-aniston-starting-a-celebrities-for-trump-group/,https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-hsn-clothing-collection-home-shopping-network/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#40343225362f32002421292c3923212c2c25326e232f2d",Have Jennifer Aniston And Other Stars Decided To Start A ‘Celebrities For Trump’ Company?,,,,,

Rick Santorum said he had “no problem” with former National Security Adviser John Bolton testifying after “this impeachment thing” ends.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “More Reputard logic, decide the case then let’s hear from the witness??” wrote one user who shared the article. Verdict: False Santorum was speaking about Bolton releasing his book, not about him testifying. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked the former Pennsylvania senator during a Jan. 28 panel for his “take” on the timing of Bolton submitting his forthcoming memoir for a White House pre-publication review and the subsequent leak of an unpublished draft to The New York Times. (RELATED: Did Kevin McCarthy Say Trump Killed Qasem Soleimani ‘Because Adam Schiff “Spent The Last Year On Impeachment”‘?) In the unpublished manuscript, Bolton alleges Trump told him in August that he wanted to continue withholding military aid from Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and other political opponents, reported The New York Times. Bolton’s lawyer, Charles Cooper, issued a statement following that story saying the book manuscript had been given to the National Security Council for review on Dec. 30. Per the CNN transcript, here’s what Santorum actually said about Bolton: This is someone who deeply believes in his worldview and what is best for America, and I think he felt compelled to write something about the state of foreign policy in American and where our country’s going. I have no problem with any of that, I have no problem with him criticizing the president. I have, actually, no problem with him recounting conversations with the president. I just really question the timing of doing this when you know that something like this could happen, and I think that was not judicious. The same day as the panel Raw Story posted an article with the headline saying, “Rick Santorum: ‘I have no problem’ with John Bolton testifying after ‘this impeachment thing’ is over.”  There is, however, no record of Santorum expressing the sentiment attributed to him in the Raw Story headline during that CNN panel discussion. A review of the transcript and video didn’t turn up a single instance of the former Pennsylvania senator using the words “testimony” or “testify” in reference to Bolton. Santorum stated later in the CNN panel that he thought Bolton should have waited “until this impeachment thing passed” to submit his book for pre-publication review. (RELATED: Does Obamacare Allow States To Waive Protections For Pre-Existing Conditions?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Nowhere does Santorum mention Bolton testifying in the CNN segment.

Police have deemed his death an accidental drowning. Fact Check: An eight-year-old Palestinian boy named Qais Abu Ramila went missing in East Jerusalem on Jan. 24, reported The Jerusalem Post. Police found his body the next day in a reservoir of rainwater, where authorities said he drowned after accidentally falling in.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The boy’s disappearance and death, some noted, caused increased tensions among Palestinians and Israelis, with some social media users claiming he was kidnapped and murdered by Israeli citizens. Some saw similarities between Abu Ramila’s disappearance and the 2014 kidnapping and murder of 16-year-old Mohammed Abu Khdeir by three Israeli citizens. Abu Khdeir’s murder was one of several events that precipitated a period of protracted violence across Israel and Palestine that led to the 2014 Gaza War, according to The Associated Press. East Jerusalem, where both Abu Ramila and Abu Khdeir lived, is home to many Palestinians but is controlled by the Israeli government, who captured it in 1967. The Israel government considers the city legally in their domain, but many people around the world consider it to be illegally occupied, according to NPR. Speculation that Abu Ramila had been kidnapped and murdered hinged on footage that the boy’s relatives initially claimed to show him getting into an unknown car. But the boy’s father later clarified it was not Abu Ramila in the footage, negating the evidence of the alleged kidnapping. Police who investigated the incident deemed it an accidental drowning and found no evidence of foul play, reported The Jerusalem Post. (RELATED: Did Nikki Haley Threaten To Cut Off Aid To Palestinian Refugees?)  Despite the lack of evidence anything nefarious occurred, the narrative that the boy had been kidnapped and murdered spread quickly on social media. Democratic Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib shared a similar claim from Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, after Ashrawi retweeted user @realSeifBitar alleging the boy had been “kidnapped & executed” by a “Herd of violent Israeli settlers.”  Three layers of what for now appears to be a blood libel. From a faceless activist to a Palestinian government official to a US Congresswoman to a global audience of 898,000 followers. pic.twitter.com/spGwJAp5RT — Eylon Levy (@EylonALevy) January 25, 2020  Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress, drew criticism for sharing the story. Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish nonprofit organization, described Tlaib’s promoting of the false narrative as “blood libel,” a term defined by Merriam-Webster as the “false and maliciously perpetuated accusation that Jews have murdered non-Jews (such as Christian children) in order to use their blood in rituals.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Ashrawi eventually deleted the tweet and apologized for sharing “something that’s not fully verified.” (RELATED: Does Airbnb ‘Blacklist’ Israeli Apartments In The West Bank While Still Doing Business In Other Disputed Regions?) WATCH:  The Michigan congresswoman also deleted her retweet and addressed that decision, tweeting, “In this era of inaccurate and manipulative news, I will also strive to hold myself to the highest standards for what I share.” Her office did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.  In this era of inaccurate and manipulative news, I will also strive to hold myself to the highest standards for what I share. Know that I always seek truth as we uplift the oppressed and fight for equality, justice, and freedom. https://t.co/wma0ykjZbF — Rashida Tlaib (@RashidaTlaib) January 28, 2020  Because there is no evidence Abu Ramila was kidnapped and murdered by Israeli citizens, and the police have ruled his death an accidental drowning, we rate the claim false.

Fact Check: Some viewers believe the animated comedy series has accurately predicted future events on a number of occasions, including The Walt Disney Company owning 20th Century Fox and Donald Trump becoming president, according to Business Insider.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral post allegedly shows four screen grabs from a 1993 episode that predicted the outbreak of the novel coronavirus: a news anchor character with a “Corona Virus” graphic behind him and a man coughing while another watches, along with Homer Simpson and the school principal character reacting to clouds of germs around their heads. “The Simpsons scares me,” reads the caption. “This episode aired 27 years ago in 1993 #CoronaVirus.” (RELATED: Did The Kaiser Permanente CEO Die Just Days After Getting A Flu Shot?) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that three of the meme’s panels do indeed come from a 1993 episode of “The Simpsons.” But that episode, titled “Marge in Chains,” depicts Springfield residents dealing with a fictional illness called the “Osaka Flu” that spread from Japan after a sick factory worker coughed into a box. The upper-left panel actually comes from a 2010 episode in which media outlets released a “House Cat Flu” to boost their viewership numbers. It has been digitally altered to replace the words “Apocalypse Meow” with “Corona Virus” in the graphic behind the news anchor character.  Yet, while those episodes do depict viral disease outbreaks, it is inaccurate to say “The Simpsons” predicted the novel respiratory virus that has so far spread from China to 23 other countries. The episodes depict outbreaks of fictional influenza viruses, and neither originated in China. The coronavirus outbreak likely started in a wet market in Wuhan, the capital city of China’s Hubei province, Business Insider reported. There have been 20,630 confirmed cases around the world as of Feb. 4, with 20,471 of them occurring in China and 159 in other countries, according to the World Health Organization.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/dashausofmemesofficial/photos/a.1232497253599565/1446620305520591/?type=3&theater,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-30-times-fox-comedy-successfully-predicted-future-1140775,https://www.businessinsider.com/the-simpsons-is-good-at-predicting-the-future-2016-11#18-lady-gagas-super-bowl-halftime-show-season-23-episode-22-18,https://www.facebook.com/dashausofmemesofficial/photos/a.1232497253599565/1446620305520591/?type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/11/25/fact-check-kaiser-permanente-bernard-tyson-death-flu-vaccine-shot/,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0701171/?ref_=ttep_ep21,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqCVB0tOSVQ,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1628665/?ref_=ttep_ep6,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5ATxwXSvKo,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200204-sitrep-15-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=88fe8ad6_2,https://www.businessinsider.com/wuhan-coronavirus-chinese-wet-market-photos-2020-1,https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200204-sitrep-15-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=88fe8ad6_2,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#364244534059447652575f5a4f55575a5a53441855595b",Did ‘The Simpsons’ Predict The Coronavirus Outbreak?,,,,,

The video was posted on what appears to be a fake news website that has no apparent affiliation with BBC News. Fact Check: The Caller has debunked a number of hoaxes related to the Jan. 26 helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant, daughter Gianna and seven others. (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Kobe Bryant’s Helicopter Crashing)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The video, titled “BREAKING NEWS: VANESSA BRYANT Recorded her SUICIDE After Depression Attack This Morning,” brands itself as content from BBC News, yet the website has no apparent affiliation with the media outlet. A search of the BBC News website turned up no coverage of Vanessa Bryant’s alleged suicide. Further adding to the video’s dubiousness, it plays a short clip of Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto reporting on some “very sad news.” The video then stops to warn that the clip contains “graphic content” and prompts viewers to share it on their Facebook timelines in order to continue watching. Its claim that Vanessa Bryant committed suicide doesn’t hold up either. The Caller didn’t find any media reports about Vanessa Bryant killing herself, only outlets debunking the claim. Vanessa Bryant posted a photo of her family on Instagram Jan. 29, thanking “millions of people who’ve shown support and love during this horrific time.”                View this post on Instagram                     My girls and I want to thank the millions of people who’ve shown support and love during this horrific time. Thank you for all the prayers. We definitely need them. We are completely devastated by the sudden loss of my adoring husband, Kobe — the amazing father of our children; and my beautiful, sweet Gianna — a loving, thoughtful, and wonderful daughter, and amazing sister to Natalia, Bianka, and Capri. We are also devastated for the families who lost their loved ones on Sunday, and we share in their grief intimately. There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now. I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved. We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon. I’m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it’s impossible to imagine life without them. But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way. Our love for them is endless — and that’s to say, immeasurable. I just wish I could hug them, kiss them and bless them. Have them here with us, forever. Thank you for sharing your joy, your grief and your support with us. We ask that you grant us the respect and privacy we will need to navigate this new reality. To honor our Team Mamba family, the Mamba Sports Foundation has set up the MambaOnThree Fund to help support the other families affected by this tragedy. To donate, please go to MambaOnThree.org.

Fact Check: Featured in the viral post is a screen grab of what appears to be a news article with the headline saying, “Texas man admits kidnapping 79 people to anally probe them while disguised as an alien.” The man confessed his crimes after being arrested by the FBI in El Paso, it claims.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “A man who was arrested by the FBI Yesterday has confessed to kidnapping and sexually assaulting several dozen people while using costumes, drugs, and special effects to have his victims believe they had been abducted by aliens,” reads the alleged article. The screen grabbed news article also includes a mugshot of the supposed perpetrator: an elderly man. But a quick reverse image search revealed the mugshot has been circulating online for at least 9 years, where the Daily Caller found it in a 2011 blog post. (RELATED: Did An 11-Year-Old Girl Kill Two Illegal Immigrants During An Attempted Home Invasion?) The story, debunked by Snopes in 2018, originated on World Daily News Report, a parody news website that disclaims that people mentioned in its articles “are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any person, living, dead or undead, is purely a miracle.” Yet, while World Daily News Report clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, the Instagram post failed to issue a similar warning.

There’s no record of a “Federal Election Integrity Program” ever existing. Fact Check: The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a measure that affords some non-citizens the right to vote in school board elections in 2018, reported the Los Angeles Times. In response, some social media users posted images with misleading claims about the measure, suggesting that California should lose its voting rights and congressional representatives as a penalty.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Now that California is registering non-citizens to vote and has refused to Cooperate with the Federal Election Integrity Program, all votes from California should be nullified and Federal Representatives from the State be removed from Congress for the benefit of all the states,” claims one such post. That local ordinance, however, only allows non-citizens who are of legal voting age and are the parent, guardian or caregiver of a child living in the city to vote in school board elections, according to the San Francisco Department of Elections. It does not permit them to vote in any other elections. The post’s claim that California refuses to comply with the “Federal Election Integrity Program” doesn’t hold up either – the program does not appear to exist. (RELATED: Do The Senators Who Voted To Confirm Kavanaugh Represent 44 Percent Of The US Population?) It may be a reference to the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which was created in 2017 to address “improper voter registrations, improper voting, fraudulent voter registrations, and fraudulent voting.” The commission was dissolved in January 2018.  Similar claims have been circulating since at least 2018, according to FactCheck.org.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Gates and his wife have previously donated to the research institute through their foundation. Fact Check: On Jan. 29, the website Big League Politics published an article, titled “HMM: Coronavirus Patent is Owned by Vaccine-Production Institute Funded by Bill Gates,” claiming the Pirbright Institute owns the patent for the new coronavirus. It also mentions a debunked conspiracy theory that a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation training simulation predicted the outbreak before it began.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    An Instagram user screen grabbed that article and posted it on the social media site, with the caption saying, “Things that make you go hmm yes that’s right Bill Gates owns the patent for the vaccine against the Virus.” Pirbright’s patent is not related to the new coronavirus that has sickened thousands of people in China, contrary to the post’s claim. (RELATED: Did The WHO Make A Coronavirus Infographic Warning Against Unprotected Sex With Animals?) The patent, filed in 2015, deals with the avian infectious bronchitis virus that infects birds, according to legal information database Justia. It also covers a porcine delta-coronavirus that infects pigs. Both are part of the coronavirus family but distinct from the 2019-nCoV virus. Pirbright confirmed in a statement to The Associated Press that the patent is not for the new coronavirus and that the research institute does not currently work with human coronaviruses.  The U.K.-based Pirbright Institute receives some funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In November 2019, their foundation awarded Pirbright a $5.5 million grant to establish its Livestock Antibody Hub, according to the Pirbright website.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The Wech Baghtu airstrike, which occurred in November 2008, occurred under the Bush administration. Fact Check: The U.S. has used drones to carry out airstrikes against militant targets since at least 2002, ProPublica reported. The Council on Foreign Relations estimates that more than 500 drone strikes took place during the Obama administration alone, with most targeting Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia. A viral image of a screen grabbed tweet alleges that Obama ordered a deadly drone strike on an Afghan wedding in Wech Baghtu. The original tweet, which has more than 2,900 likes, uses the alleged Obama-era strike to justify President Donald Trump’s ordering of the drone strike that killed top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “I’m old enough to remember when Obama droned a wedding in Wech Baghtu Afghanistan to take out some low level insurgents, killing 23 children, 10 women and wounding 27 others, not a damn word from congress,” states the tweet. “#Soleimani is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US troops, so STFU.” However, the post gets the administration wrong. The airstrike, which occurred on Nov. 3, 2008, actually happened during the Bush administration, according to The New York Times. It’s unclear whether a drone carried out the airstrike, but it did kill 33 women and children, reported NBC News. Obama didn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2009, more than two months after that strike took place. (RELATED: Is The US Spending $50 Billion A Year In Afghanistan?) In 2013, the U.S. carried out a drone strike on a wedding party that it mistook for an al-Qaeda convoy in Yemen. That Obama-era drone strike killed at least 13 people, including the groom’s son, according to The Washington Post.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

He received $1.9 million in funding from a “Shark Tank” investor, it claims.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There’s no record of a boy inventing such a device or appearing on “Shark Tank.” The video uses footage of a young boy who went on “Shark Tank” to pitch his lemonade stand business to investors. Fact Check: The viral video, captioned “11-Yr-Old Orphan Creates Device To Give The World Free Wifi,” tells the story of a young orphan who allegedly received a $1.9 million investment in his free Wi-Fi invention after appearing on “Shark Tank.” It has more than 251,000 views on Facebook.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “An 11-yr-old orphan just murdered the trillion dollar WiFi industry,” claims the video. “In the most viewed episode in the show’s history, the billionaires were fighting each other to invest in the boy.” However, the Daily Caller found no record of an 11-year-old orphan named Johnny ever seeking an investment from the sharks on ABC’s hit entrepreneurship reality show. If a child had “murdered the trillion dollar WiFi industry” with such a device as the video claims, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it. The boy shown in the video is actually young entrepreneur Jack Bonneau. He appeared on a November 2016 episode of “Shark Tank” with his father to present his lemonade stand business. Chris Sacca, founder of venture capital firm Lowercase Capital, ultimately offered Bonneau a $50,000 loan, which Bonneau accepted. The video also takes footage from Bonneau’s other media appearances, including a TEDx talk, and from other episodes of “Shark Tank.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/111270660414599/videos/p.196663391708689/196663391708689/?type=2&theater,https://www.facebook.com/111270660414599/videos/p.196663391708689/196663391708689/?type=2&theater,https://abc.com/shows/shark-tank/about-the-show,https://www.sharktankcontestant.com/,https://www.google.com/search?q=%22johnny%22+AND+%22orphan%22+AND+%22invent%22+AND+%22wi-fi%22+AND+%22shark+tank%22&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS850US850&oq=%22johnny%22+AND+%22orphan%22+AND+%22invent%22+AND+%22wi-fi%22+AND+%22shark+tank%22&aqs=chrome..69i57.19236j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/business/young-entrepreneurs-sweeten-the-lemonade-stand-model.html?_r=0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq9K8ZAFAJg&feature=emb_title,https://www.jacksstands.com/,https://www.forbes.com/profile/chris-sacca/#257c7f9b220a,https://www.jacksstands.com/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a6d2d4c3d0c9d4e6c2c7cfcadfc5c7cacac3d488c5c9cb",Did An 11 Year-Old ‘Shark Tank’ Contestant Invent A Device To Give The World Free Wi-Fi?,,,,,

The plague refers to diseases caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis. Fact Check: The tweet, which was screen grabbed and posted on Facebook, masquerades as a breaking news alert from a news outlet, saying, “BREAKING: World Health Organization officially declares the Coronavirus as a plague.” An estimated 340,000 people in China have been infected and 75,000 have died, it claims.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    At first glance, the news alert appears authentic, as it mimics the breaking news format used by some outlets on Twitter. But a closer inspection of its claims reveal that it is not credible. The Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports about the WHO designating the new coronavirus, which has killed some 170 people, as a plague. No press releases making such an announcement appear on the organization’s website. The WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency Jan. 30. (RELATED: Did The WHO Make A Coronavirus Infographic Warning Against Unprotected Sex With Animals?) According to the WHO, the term “plague” only refers to infectious diseases caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis.

There have been 7,736 confirmed cases and 12,167 suspected cases of coronavirus in China to date, according to the WHO’s Jan. 30 situation report.

Global outbreak includes 98 cases in 18 countries, outside China. More info, including tips on how to stay healthy: https://t.co/tsGUhNhrv2 pic.twitter.com/ZDyTXeVXyg — United Nations (@UN) January 30, 2020  Other WHO recommendations to reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus include washing hands, covering the mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing, avoiding close contact with people suffering from cold or flu-like symptoms and thoroughly cooking meat and eggs.  Researchers are still learning how exactly the new coronavirus spreads from person to person, but transmission is most likely between people with close contact, according to Fox News. On Jan. 30, the United States and South Korea confirmed its first cases of person-to-person transmission. According to the WHO’s Jan. 30 report, there have been 7,818 confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world, with 7,736 of those occurring in China and 82 occurring in other countries. Only five confirmed cases of the virus have been documented in the U.S. (at the time of publication), according to the Centers for Disease Control.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Jan. 30, after the virus spread from China to at least 18 other countries.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

None of the contaminated beef was sold in Burger King restaurants. Fact Check: The article, published on Worthytoshare.com, appears to reference a real beef contamination incident involving one of Burger King’s suppliers in the U.K, though it inflates Burger King’s involvement and its impact on the company. (RELATED: Video Claims A NYC Restaurant Got A License To Serve Human Meat)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In January 2013, Burger King announced that it had stopped purchasing beef from Silvercrest Foods as a “voluntary and precautionary measure” after tests found horse DNA in some of the Irish meat supplier’s products, reported CBS News. Silvercrest, which was owned by ABP Food Group at the time, had imported the contaminated beef from an unapproved supplier in Poland, according to a 2013 Burger King press release. There is, however, no evidence that Burger King “tried to sweep it under the rug,” nor that the company admitted to selling burgers containing horse meat supplied by Silvercrest. In fact, Burger King issued a press release contradicting the article’s claim Jan. 31, 2013. “Our independent DNA test results on products taken from BURGER KING® restaurants were negative for any equine DNA,” the company said in that press release. “However, four samples recently taken from the Silvercrest plant have shown the presence of very small trace levels of equine DNA. This product was never sold to our restaurants.” This isn’t the first time claims about Burger King serving contaminated sandwiches have circulated online. In 2017, fact-checking website PolitiFact debunked a similar article. Snopes debunked another the year before that.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsMatt NoelFact Check ReporterFollow Matt on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Rashida Tlaib wore a “symbolic scarf patterned after the Islamic terrorist state.” Facebook/Screenshot “She’s a member of Congress,” reads part of the post. “Let that sink in… are you ok with this given her stated allegiance is with our sworn enemies who chant DEATH TO AMERICA?”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The photo shows Tlaib wearing a keffiyeh, a checkered scarf that represents “solidarity with the Palestinian people.” It does not symbolize the Islamic State. Fact Check: The viral post features two photos of people wearing checkered scarves known as keffiyehs: one of an armed individual with the scarf over his face, the other of Tlaib with the scarf around her neck. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Rashida Tlaib Celebrating Trump’s Impeachment?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “A U.S. Congresswoman wears the symbolic scarf patterned after the Islamic terrorist state,” claims the post. “She’s on the floor of the House of Congress. She does so with her hand over her heart” Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American woman elected to Congress, did wear a keffiyeh on the House floor Dec. 6, while delivering remarks against House Resolution 326, which promotes a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But, contrary to the post’s claim, the keffiyeh does not symbolize the Islamic State. The keffiyeh actually represents “a solidarity with the Palestinian people,” said University of Northern Iowa political science professor Evan Renfro, according to The Associated Press. “There’s no connotation with terrorism.” The red-and-white keffiyeh, PolitiFact reported, is often associated with Islamic militant group Hamas, while the black-and-white version connects more to Fatah, a nationalist group that has renounced armed violence. Keffiyeh-inspired fashion designs have been worn by people around the world, according to The Guardian.  This isn’t the first time Tlaib has worn traditional Palestinian clothing. In January 2019, she wore a traditional Palestinian gown to her swearing in to the House of Representatives, reported CNN.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJustin CarusoContributor","https://www.facebook.com/americasforces/posts/773355569838879,https://www.facebook.com/americasforces/posts/773355569838879,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/09/the-keffiyeh-symbol-of-palestinian-struggle-falls-victim-to-fashion,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/12/29/fact-check-photo-rashida-tlaib-celebrating-donald-trump-impeachment/,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/03/politics/rashida-tlaib-breaking-barriers/index.html,https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4836198/user-clip-rashida-tlaib-israels-occupation,https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-resolution/326,https://thehill.com/homenews/house/473282-house-moves-ahead-on-long-stalled-resolution-supporting-two-states-for,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8335620018,https://www.politifact.com/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2020/jan/17/blog-posting/post-falsely-ties-tlaib-scarf-islamic-state/,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/11/fashion/shows/11KAFFIYEH.html,http://wiki.arcs.com/article/The_Husayn_Day_Peace_Walks_of_SABA_Mosque,https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2017/10/hamas-fatah-goal-approaches-171012064342008.html,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/aug/09/the-keffiyeh-symbol-of-palestinian-struggle-falls-victim-to-fashion,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a25714487/rashida-tlaib-thobe-sworn-into-congress/,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/03/us/women-wear-palestinian-gowns-rashida-tlaib/index.html",Viral Image Links Rashida Tlaib’s Scarf To The ‘Islamic Terrorist State’,,,,,

A two-year FBI investigation found the allegation against the Dothan Police Department non-credible. Fact Check:  The post describes an alleged police conspiracy to arrest innocent black men in Dothan, Alabama. The Henry County Report, a website described by The New Republic as a “hyper-local blog,” first reported it.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    That 2015 report, titled “Leaked Documents Reveal Dothan Police Department Planted Drugs on Young Black Men For Years, District Attorney Doug Valeska Complicit,” said a group of white Dothan police officers who belonged to an unnamed white supremacist group had planted drugs and guns on more than 1,000 black men since the 1990s. Those crimes, it claimed, were covered up by then-District Attorney Doug Valeska. Jon Carroll, the author of the Henry County Report article, said he obtained a trove of internal documents from the Alabama Justice Project that proved those allegations, linking to some in his report. But the documents Carroll provided did not prove what he suggested they did. (RELATED: Does Chicago Have 3 Times As Many Murders As New York City?) According to Slate, none of the documents clearly support the claim that Dothan police officers planted evidence on more than 1,000 black men. Instead, they appear to allude to potential officer misconduct, such as the mishandling of evidence. The names of the officers in the documents were mostly redacted. Dothan Police Chief Steve Parrish, who Carroll identified as a participant in the conspiracy, gave a statement calling the report “outright lies.”  “In today’s social media driven society, many individuals take what they read on the Internet as factual. While I am not in the habit of responding to misinformation published online by bloggers, accusations made concerning the credibility of the men and women of this agency shall not go unanswered,” Parrish said in a 2015 press briefing. “There are simply too many outright lies and fabrications in the blog to address individually, but his ‘opinion’ has apparently been taken by many as ‘fact.'” Despite the lack of supporting evidence, the story quickly spread on social media and got picked up by some national outlets, like The New Republic and The Week. The Southern Poverty Law Center also tweeted a link to the story, but the organization later retracted it, citing questions about the reporting.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Carroll promised in a 2015 interview to release more documents to corroborate his allegations after Slate raised concerns about the sourcing of the report, but it’s unclear if he ever actually did. His report has since been removed from the Henry County Report’s website. The Daily Caller News Foundation sent the Henry County Report a request for comment, but it bounced back. (RELATED: Are Human Traffickers Putting Zip Ties On Windshield Wipers To Distract Victims?) Parrish requested an FBI investigation in response to Carroll’s blog post. That two-year FBI probe into the allegation against the Dothan Police Department did not find a single substantiated case of officers planting evidence, according to a 38-page FBI summary reviewed by the Dothan Eagle. In 2016, several retired Ozark Police officers sued Carroll for defamation in response to a story in which he indicated a former Ozark police officer was responsible for the unsolved 1999 murders of two teenage girls, according to the Dothan Eagle. The documents Carroll provided for his claim that Dothan police planted evidence on more than 1,000 innocent black men lacks sufficient evidence, and an FBI investigation found his allegation non-credible.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The legislative costs of impeachment are paid out of the congressional budget for conducting its duties. The claim originated in an article published on a satire website. Fact Check: A viral post claiming Pelosi diverted Social Security funds to pay for impeachment costs has been making the rounds on Facebook recently. This comes as the House speaker signed the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump Jan. 15, before sending them to the Senate for the trial. “Pelosi diverts 2.4 billion from social security to pay for impeachment,” reads the post. “This cannot be allowed. She does not want this getting out, please help.” (RELATED: Did Every Democrat Vote Against A Cost-Of-Living Increase For Social Security?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    That claim, however, originated in an article published on Potatriotsunite.com, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” The article is filed under the “satire that makes you horny” category. Social Security Works Executive Director Alex Lawson told WUSA9 that it would be impossible for Pelosi to divert money from Social Security. “The law is really clear here that the premiums that we pay into Social Security can only be used for benefits and the administration of the services to provide those benefits,” Lawson told WUSA9. The legislative costs of impeachment are taken from the funds allocated to Congress for conducting its duties, according to Yahoo Finance.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

However, the Daily Caller found no record of 11 Marines dying in the week leading up to the post nor the week following it. A review of Pentagon press releases didn’t turn up any instances of Marine deaths in the past two months. The Military Times’ “Honor the Fallen” project doesn’t mention any either. The 11 men, whose service spanned two branches of the American military and one branch of the British military, all died in Afghanistan over a five-day period in July 2010.

His birthday was in August, while hers was in May. Fact Check:  Misinformation about the victims of the Jan. 26 helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant, daughter Giana and seven other individuals has spread widely across social media. In this case, a post claims Kobe and Gianna Bryant shared the same birthday.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Wow so sad they both share the same birthday but of course different years and die on the same day,” reads the post. “Bonded forever.” (RELATED: Viral Video Claims To Show Kobe Bryant’s Helicopter Crashing) That is, however, not the case. Kobe Bryant was born on Aug. 23, according to the NBA website, while 13-year-old Gianna celebrated her birthday on May 1. They shared a passion for basketball. On May 1, Kobe Bryant posted photos of Gianna on Instagram to wish her a happy 13th birthday.               View this post on Instagram                     Happy 13th birthday my Gigi!

Many celebrities, athletes and politicians paid tribute to Kobe and Gianna Bryant in the aftermath of the tragedy. Fans in the Philippines painted a giant mural of the pair embracing on a Manila basketball court, according to ESPN.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The Daily Caller has previously fact-checked misinformation related to the tragic helicopter crash.

Fact Check: The viral Instagram post features a black-and-white photograph of a crowd waiting for the 1939 execution of convicted murder Eugen Weidmann, the last man to be publicly guillotined in France. It appears on the Getty Images website. “The last public execution by guillotine in France happened after ‘Star Wars’ premiered,” claims the post. “And it was all caught on camera.” (RELATED: Does Emmanuel Macron Want The Rebuilt Notre Dame To Represent A More ‘Diverse’ France?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Weidmann’s execution, however, happened roughly 38 years before the premiere of “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope,” the first film of the original “Star Wars” trilogy. It premiered in May 1977, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Although his 1939 death marked France’s final public execution via guillotine, the country continued privately using them for capital punishment for several decades. France stopped using guillotines in 1977, after beheading Tunisian convicted murderer Hamida Djandoubi on Sept. 10 that year, according to The Daily Telegraph. That execution, which occurred just a few months after the release of “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope,” was also the country’s last ever use of capital punishment. France abolished the death penalty in 1981, reported the Washington Post.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.instagram.com/p/B7zqZDbDkR5/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.instagram.com/p/B7zqZDbDkR5/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading,https://www.instagram.com/realhistoryuncovered/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/crowd-waits-for-the-execution-of-eugen-weidmann-on-june-17-news-photo/1143384498?adppopup=true,https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/17/eighty-years-since-versailles-execution-gave-public-guillotines-the-chop,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/crowd-waits-for-the-execution-of-eugen-weidmann-on-june-17-news-photo/1143384498?adppopup=true,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/04/17/fact-check-emmanuel-macron-notre-dame-rebuilt-modern-diverse/,https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Hope-Mark-Hamill/dp/B00VF06OBS,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-flashback-no-theater-wanted-show-movie-1977-846864,https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/17/eighty-years-since-versailles-execution-gave-public-guillotines-the-chop,https://www.wired.com/2007/09/dayintech-0910-2/,https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/today-in-history/frances-last-guillotine-execution-only-40-years-ago/news-story/8caad52e38a2761ea708fbfc8c767025,https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/today-in-history/frances-last-guillotine-execution-only-40-years-ago/news-story/8caad52e38a2761ea708fbfc8c767025,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-flashback-no-theater-wanted-show-movie-1977-846864,https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/09/18/france-will-retire-its-guillotine-and-abolish-the-death-penalty/3ab103aa-ebc0-40db-a311-a7525c704a4b/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#51252334273e23113530383d2832303d3d34237f323e3c",Did France’s Last Public Execution By Guillotine Occur After The Premiere Of The First ‘Star Wars’ Movie?,,,,,

It includes statistics from some Australian states covering the entire year, rather than just the current fire season. The figure also counts all bushfire-related law enforcement actions in other states. Fact Check:  Bushfires have swept across Australia since September 2019, killing at least 30 people and burning more than 24.7 million acres, according to BBC News. Australia recorded its hottest and driest year yet in 2019, providing the perfect conditions for intense and prolonged bushfires, which many scientists say have been exacerbated by climate change.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Sun and several other media outlets ran headlines alleging that police have arrested nearly 200 people for deliberately starting the wildfires. Some, like The Sun and InfoWars, cited vague police data from various Australian states. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Baby Koala Rescued From The Australian Wildfires By A Golden Retriever) “FIRESTARTERS More than 180 people arrested for arson as Australia bushfires left 26 dead and razed 2,000 homes,” reads The Sun’s headline. “Many have blamed the fires on climate change but new shocking figures have revealed cops in the country have arrested 183 people suspected of starting fires in the wild,” writes The Sun later its article. “A total of 101 people have been arrested in Queensland, 24 in New South Wales, 43 in Victoria, five in Tasmania and 10 in South Australia.” But according to Australian law enforcement spokespeople, that figure includes statistics from some states covering the entire year, rather than just the current fire season. The figure also counts all bushfire-related law enforcement actions in other states.  A spokesperson for the Queensland Police Force told The Guardian that the 101 figure cited for the state represents “police enforcement actions” for a broad range of bushfire-related offenses, including “charging, restorative justice or cautioning.” That means the figure does not represent the total number of individuals arrested for deliberately starting wildfires, as The Sun and other outlets suggested. Legal actions can range from cautions to fines to criminal charges for offenses less severe than arson. Since Nov. 8, 2019, New South Wales (NSW) police have taken action against 183 people for 205 bushfire-related offenses, according to a Jan. 6 NSW Police Force statement. Of those 183 individuals, 24 were charged with deliberately setting bushfires, while others face legal action for, among other offenses, not complying with the total fire ban or improperly discarding lit cigarettes or matches, per an email from the NSW Police Force media unit.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The reported 43 figure for Victoria counts all recorded offenses of intentionally or recklessly causing bushfires for the year ending September 2019, according to data provided to the DCNF by the state’s Crime Statistics Agency. That means those offenses occurred before the current bushfire season. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Australian Fires From Above?) In Tasmania, there have been at least five charges for arson, including two for attempted arson, over the past six months, though those charges typically refer to non bushfire-specific incidents, according to News.com.au. Since July 1, 2019, there have been at least two charges for unlawfully setting fire to vegetation. South Australia has seen 10 arrests or reports for causing bushfires intentionally or recklessly between Sept. 1, 2019 and Jan. 8, 2020, Senior Constable Rebecca Stokes told the DCNF in an email.

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The photo, taken in 1990, shows Eric Trump’s sixth birthday party. Parnas would have been 18 at the time, whereas the man in the photo looks much older. Fact Check: A viral image showing a birthday party for young Eric Trump has been circulating on Twitter and Facebook over the past week. It identified the man standing next to President Donald Trump in the photo as Parnas, a former associate of the president’s personal lawyer who was indicted on campaign finance charges. “Here is a photo of Lev Parnas who I have never met celebrating Eric’s birthday party 25 years ago,” claims the post. “25 YEARS I HAVEN’T KNOWN THIS MAN!”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Taken in 1990, the photo shows Eric Trump’s sixth birthday party at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, per its caption. Ivana Trump, the mother of Eric Trump and the first wife of Donald Trump, shared the family photo with ABC News in October 2017 while promoting her book “Raising Trump.” Parnas, born in 1972, would have been 18 years old in 1990. The man in the photo appears to be visibly older than that. (RELATED: Did Trump And Jeffrey Epstein Pose For A Picture With A Young Ivanka?) Furthermore, Parnas’ lawyer, Joseph Bondy, debunked the claim on Twitter Jan. 20, writing, “In response to a number of inquiries, the picture below, apparently taken at @EricTrump’s 6th birthday party, is not Lev Parnas. #LevRemembers #LetLevSpeak.”  In response to a number of inquiries, the picture below, apparently taken at @EricTrump’s 6th birthday party, is not Lev Parnas. #LevRemembers #LetLevSpeak pic.twitter.com/KjuJHt8eYR — Joseph A. Bondy (@josephabondy) January 20, 2020   In October 2019, Parnas told The New Yorker that he didn’t get to know Donald Trump until the 2016 campaign, though they apparently “bumped into” each other “plenty of times” in New York over the years. Trump denied knowing Parnas in a Jan. 16 press conference, saying, “I don’t know who this man is.” However, Parnas has been photographed with the president, his family members and Vice President Mike Pence.

Fact Check: The article, titled “LeBron To NBA: ‘Dump The Anthem Or I’ll Quit,'” originated on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” “To have it played before the games of the greatest player this league has ever known – ME – is hugely insulting. It shows me that you do not respect your star,” the article quotes him as saying in a letter to the NBA. “And this after all I’ve selflessly done for you. I DEMAND THAT THIS NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In October 2019, James faced backlash for yelling “Let’s go!” during the national anthem before the season opener against the Los Angeles Clippers, according to the Washington Examiner. The satire article appears to draw inspiration from that incident. Yet, while Bustatroll.org clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, USA News and Gamertwin.com portray James’ ultimatum about the pregame playing of the national anthem at NBA games as a real news story. Other websites do the same, with some linking to fake videos that redirect readers to advertisements. (RELATED: Did LeBron James Wear A ‘Same Crime’ Protest T-Shirt?)

Experts and journalists gave the Daily Caller News Foundation lower estimates. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Virginia Division of Capitol Police estimated 22,000 people attended the Jan. 20 gun-rights rally in Richmond to protest various recent gun control proposals. Some officials feared violence might occur at the rally, particularly after the FBI announced days before that it had arrested three alleged members of white supremacist group The Base. But, despite these concerns, the rally remained peaceful, with only one reported arrest, according to The Washington Post. “Thousands Of Pro-Gun Activists And Far-Right Extremists Swarm Richmond, Virginia,” read HuffPost’s headline for a Jan. 20 article on the rally. (RELATED: Article Claims Trump Will Sign An Executive Order Creating Term Limits For Congress) To support the claim, the HuffPost author pointed to the presence of groups such as the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and American Guard, as well as other unnamed “far-right militants, conspiracy theorists.” Pictures and videos from the rally confirm that members of those groups were, in fact, in attendance. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a legal advocacy group, has designated the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys as “extremists” and the American Guard as a “hate group,” while the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish nonprofit organization, characterizes all three groups as “extremists.”  Experts agreed some far-right extremists likely did attend the Richmond gun-rights rally but disputed HuffPost’s “thousands” number. “It’s reasonable to assume that some far right extremists attended the event insofar as gun ownership rights loom large in their worldview,” explained George Michael, a professor of criminal justice at Westfield State University and author of “Confronting Right Wing Extremism and Terrorism in the USA,” in an email to the DCNF. “However, I didn’t see evidence of far-right involvement on an organizational level.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “I’ve seen nothing to suggest that there were thousands of far-right extremists in attendance,” said Darren Mulloy, a Wilfrid Laurier University history professor and author of “Enemies of the State: The Radical Right in American from FDR to Trump,” in an email to the DCNF. Laird Wilcox, co-author of “American Extremists Militias, Supremacists, Klansmen, Communists & Others,” also told the DCNF he did not see evidence that “thousands” of “far right extremists” attended the rally. “It was mostly single-issue people concerned about the Second Amendment. Most of those people were middle to moderate-right conservatives,” he said. “They were not ‘far-right extremists.'” Only one journalist that the DCNF talked to speculated the number could be high, but he took pains to make clear his number was an estimate. “I would say less than, but somewhere hovering around 20% of the folks at the rally likely met this qualification,” said Robert Evans, a Bellingcat investigative reporter present at the gun-rights rally. “I’d say I personally saw somewhere around a dozen [Right Wing Death Squad] patches, in addition to ‘helicopter’ shirts and imagery (references to how the Pinochet regime executed left-wing dissidents). I also saw hundreds and hundreds of references to the ‘boogaloo,’ the idea of an inevitable coming second civil war.” Townhall reporter Julio Rosas told the DCNF that “very few” members of the aforementioned groups were there, while New2Share editor-in-chief Ford Fischer estimated “in the hundreds.” But individuals wearing such imagery aren’t necessarily “far-right extremists.” On its website, the ADL notes that “gamers and history buffs” make references to “boogaloo.” Some individuals “still use the phrase as a joke,” according to the ADL. Even if all such people were considered far-right extremists, there is no definitive way to determine the exact ratio of far-right extremists to gun advocates and other attendees at the rally. Social media only turned up anecdotal instances of such imagery. Neither the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism nor the Counter Extremism Project, organizations that extensively study and track U.S. extremism, had information about who or what groups attended the rally. “This was different from [Charlottesville, Virginia] in many ways in that there hardened bigots and violent extremists were key to the organizing of the event,” Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism Director Brian Levin told the DCNF in an email. “Richmond’s had been going on for years and was not organized by bigots. That being said, outside extremists made a very big deal about the Richmond event online.” No other policy organizations could corroborate HuffPost’s claim, and the DCNF found no evidence that “thousands” of “far-right extremists” attended the rally. We rate this headline false. Trevor Schakohl and Elias Atienza contributed to this report.

Happy Birthday MLK. Thank you. Funny how ppl always tell the part of the story that’s doesn’t involve their bullshit doings. Tell your kids to tell their teacher to talk about this next month during Black History Month when they bring up his name. A post shared by  montanaof300 (@montanaof300) on Jan 15, 2020 at 11:54pm PST     googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Tell your kids to tell their teacher to talk about this next month during Black History Month when they bring up his name,” urges the post. Verdict: False A congressional report determined that King died from a single gunshot wound. The Justice Department found no evidence that the government conspired to kill King in a review of the 1999 lawsuit. The image in the post was taken roughly ten years before King’s assassination. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Rapper Montana of 300 posted a meme Jan. 16 that falsely claims King died in the hospital from being smothered. The post includes a photo of King lying in what appears to be a hospital bed. (RELATED: Does Alabama Celebrate Robert E. Lee And Martin Luther King Jr. On The Same Day?) “Did y’all know that MLK didn’t die from the bullet that hit him? He was killed (smothered) in the hospital,” reads the meme. “Also in 1999 the US government was found guilty in a court of law of conspiring to kill him but was silenced by the media… YALL NOT READY FOR THIS TALK THO (sic).” A 1979 House Select Committee on Assassinations report found King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, after being shot around 6 p.m. at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. He died roughly an hour later at St. Joseph Hospital from a “gunshot wound to the chin and neck with a total transaction of the lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord and other structures of the neck,” according to the report. The image in the Instagram post does not depict King in the hospital after being shot that day. The photo, taken by The Associated Press in 1958, actually shows King recovering from an operation to remove a steel letter opener that a mentally unstable woman stabbed in his chest ten years earlier, according to the caption.  As evidence that King died at the hospital in a government plot, the post cites a 1999 wrongful death lawsuit brought against Memphis cafe owner Loyd Jowers by lawyer William Peppers on behalf of the King family. Jowers had claimed he hired someone other than James Earl Ray, the man who originally pleaded guilty to assassinating King but later recanted his confession, to kill King. The jury ruled in that civil suit that Jowers and “others, including governmental agencies” conspired to assassinate King. (RELATED: Did MLK Say, ‘I Will Not Rejoice In The Death Of One, Not Even An Enemy’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  However, the Justice Department found no evidence to back up the verdict in a 2000 review of the lawsuit. Civil suits only need a “preponderance of evidence” to prove the case, which lower standard than the burden of “beyond reasonable doubt” in criminal cases, according to Cornell Law School. “Most of the witnesses and writings offered to support the various government-directed conspiracy claims relied exclusively on secondhand and thirdhand hearsay and speculation,” wrote the Justice Department. “Additionally, none of these allegations were ever linked together.” The New York Times, CNN and other media outlets covered the 1999 trial.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It has more than 147,000 views to date.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “As a species, we are at the top of the food chain, and the only meat left to tackle was other humans,” the video quotes Michelin star chef Mario Dorcy as saying. “We battled long and hard to be able to serve human meat in our restaurant, and the government finally conceded that we were in the right.” Clearview TV retracted its report Dec. 3 upon discovering it was “fiction,” but social media users have continued to share the video, portraying it as a real news story. (RELATED: Was Jane Fonda Denied Service At A Restaurant Run By A Vietnam Veteran?) The claim likely comes from a March 2016 article from Empire News, a parody news website that describes its content as satire “intended for entertainment purposes only.” That article names the same chef and quotes him as making the same comment. But, as Empire News clearly disclaims on its website, neither the restaurant nor the chef mentioned in the video actually exist. There is no record of a New York City restaurant operating under the name Skin, and the chef’s name hasn’t been mentioned in the Michelin Guide’s coverage of chefs and restaurants.  The Food and Drug Administration told the Daily Caller it considers the sale of “human meat” to be illegal. Most states also have laws that prohibit people from obtaining and consuming human flesh, according to the Legal Information Institute at Cornell Law School.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/Iamtaesean/posts/10156580922171254,https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=hPAC3wEZ3fc&app=desktop&fbclid=IwAR0E9fgjloa5v6J_1OS0tsfzMoF3ucP-wSX5Qg4jW3OpfrvitBuKp5gg4gA&has_verified=1&bpctr=1580134381,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WffTYKEDHyA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrAiq6MB1Ww,https://www.facebook.com/Iamtaesean/posts/10156580922171254,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/09/fact-check-jane-fonda-ted-turner-denied-service-restaurant-vietnam-veteran/,https://empirenews.net/new-york-city-restaurant-becomes-first-to-get-license-to-serve-human-flesh/,https://empirenews.net/about-disclaimer/,https://www.google.com/search?biw=1288&bih=679&ei=GhImXu-jLYfY-wTr9blA&q=Skin+restaurant+New+York&oq=Skin+restaurant+New+York&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67j0l2.0.0..14436...3.0..0.121.588.0j5......0......gws-wiz.......0i30.0q18PuuWb5c&ved=0ahUKEwjvmILOhpPnAhUH7J4KHet6DggQ4dUDCAs&uact=5,https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/search?q=Mario+Dorsey,https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/cannibalism,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#770305120118053713161e1b0e14161b1b12055914181a",Video Claims A NYC Restaurant Got A License To Serve Human Meat,,,,,

[Facebook/Screenshot]Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The article originated on the satire website Daily World Update. Fact Check: The website Coffeerelax.co published an article Jan. 21 that claims Trump will sign an executive order establishing term limits for Congress in the next week. Multiple users have shared it on Facebook, with one post garnering more than 1,000 shares. (RELATED: Was A White Supremacist Invited To The White House A Day After The Midterms?) “The fat cats on The Hill Will (sic) be moaning about this endlessly.

We are draining the swamp.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports of Trump planning to institute term limits on Congress via executive order. There’s no record of such an executive order on his verified Twitter accounts or the White House website. The White House staffer quoted in the article appears to be fictional, as Martin’s name appears nowhere in the 2019 annual report of White House personnel to Congress. A quick internet search revealed the name has actually cropped up in several satire articles, making the article even more suspect. In fact, the article originated on Daily World Update, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network of “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” While Daily Wold Update clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, Coffeerelax.co and other websites that picked up the story failed to do the same. They portray it as a real news story. Trump has previously spoken in favor of such a move. During his 2016 presidential campaign, he called for term limits for Congress as part of an ethics reform proposal, according to The Hill.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/groups/1056035501164679/permalink/2329283797173170,https://coffeerelax.co/trump-to-sign-executive-order-creating-term-limits-for-congress/?fbclid=IwAR2PYdSifzwCH-UhIS-c3_z0GzNtigWCeVM_8Gm7k3TUQHxGzN30CM1HqQs,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/11/08/fact-check-white-supremacist-invited-white-house-midterms/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22executive%20order%22%20AND%20%22term%20limits%22%20AND%20%22Congress%22%20(from%3ArealDonaldTrump%20OR%20from%3APOTUS)&src=typed_query,https://www.whitehouse.gov/search/?s=%22term+limit%22+%22congress%22+%22executive+order%22,https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/July-1-2019-Report-FINAL.pdf,https://bustatroll.org/2019/12/15/canadian-dems-and-one-unidentified-black-guy-for-trump/,https://tatersgonnatate.com/impeachment-likely-to-fail-as-27-house-dems-reveal-theyll-vote-no/,https://dailyworldupdate.us/trump-to-sign-executive-order-creating-term-limits-for-congress/,https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/,https://dailyworldupdate.us/about/,https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/301611-trump-proposes-term-limits-for-congress-members,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#780c0a1d0e170a381c191114011b1914141d0a561b1715",Article Claims Trump Will Sign An Executive Order Creating Term Limits For Congress,,,,,

Per comments from Pelosi’s office and the pen supplier, the total cost ranged somewhere between $450 and $600. Fact Check: Pelosi used 30 custom pens engraved with her name to sign the articles of impeachment against the president Jan. 15, Business Insider reported. Shortly thereafter, she handed them out to other House Democrats for keepsakes, drawing criticism from some Republican members of Congress.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    On Jan. 17, a Facebook post alleged the House speaker spent thousands of dollars on those pens, claiming, “Here is PROOF that this Impeachment Sham is all about pushing Nancy Pelosi’s agenda! $15,000 for pens to sign the impeachment doc’s. Look who’s name is on them!” However, the total cost cited in the Facebook post is much higher than the amount Pelosi’s office actually spent on the pens. Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, told FactCheck.org that “the cost per pen is just under $15,” which equates to roughly $450 in total. Garland Writing Instruments, a Rhode Island-based company, told WPRI Eyewitness News it produced the customized pens Pelosi used. Owner Rick Becker said the pens cost roughly $20 each, according to the local Fox affiliate. That price would mean Pelosi’s office spent approximately $600 on the 30 pens.  Indeed, both of those figures are significantly lower than the $15,000 total cost cited in the Facebook post. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say, ‘It Is Dangerous To Let The Voters Decide Trump’s Fate’?)

The Daily Caller found no record the statement in the Hawaii congresswoman’s verified Twitter accounts nor ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets. Another post claims Gabbard made a similar statement in the “Parties” section of her lawsuit against Clinton.   “Tulsi Gabbard is a natural person who is a citizen and domiciliary of the State of Hawaii,” allegedly reads part of the lawsuit. “She has never experienced, does not currently experience, and does not expect to experience, thoughts of suicide.” But a quick search of the actual lawsuit shows it simply states Gabbard’s citizenship and state of residence.

The article originated on a satire website. Fact Check: The House voted Dec. 18 to impeach President Donald Trump on counts of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Nearly a month later, Pelosi transmitted the articles to the Senate, where the trial has since gotten underway, according to CBS News. Maga2020 News alleged in a Jan. 20 article, titled “Pelosi: ‘If Impeachment Fails, I Will Resign Immediately,'” that the House speaker announced she intends to resign from Congress if the articles of impeachment don’t receive enough votes to pass. She made the announcement during an interview with Belgian magazine Le Mensonge, it claims.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “If this impeachment fails, my time is probably up,” Pelosi is also quoted as saying in the interview. “I won’t wait around. If it doesn’t go through, I’ll resign.” There is, however, no evidence Pelosi ever made such a statement. It appears on neither her House speaker nor her congressional website. The Daily Caller didn’t find any similar announcements on any of her social media accounts either. Further adding to the post’s dubiousness. Le Mensonge magazine doesn’t appear to exist. “Le Mensonge” roughly translates from French to “The Lie.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Nancy Pelosi’s House And Her Congressional District) The article originated on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.”  Yet, while Bustatroll.org clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, other websites that picked up the story failed to do the same.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The East India Company, a British trading company that operated from 1600 to 1874, engaged in the trading of spices, silk, indigo and other products with Southeast Asia and India. It eventually became an agent of British imperialism in the region, according to BBC. (RELATED: No, British Parliament Didn’t Ban Lipstick In 1770 For Fear It Had ‘The Power To Seduce Men Into Marriage’) A viral post that has been shared more than 11,000 times falsely alleged the image shows a 282-year-old merchant vessel owned by that British company as it “returns to London for the first time since 1787.” Similar claims have also cropped up on Twitter. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the ship has been misidentified. The photo, found on the BBC News website, actually shows a replica of the Swedish East India Company‘s Götheborg merchant ship traveling down the Thames River. That replica was built in 2005. The Swedish East India Company constructed the original Götheborg ship roughly 282 years ago in 1738. It sank off the coast of Sweden in 1745, according to the replica’s website.  In May 2007, the replica merchant ship sailed to London as part of a two-year voyage recreating the trade routes the original ship would have taken, according to BBC News. It has also visited China, South Africa, and various European countries. “The ship, modelled on the original 18th Century Swedish ship the Gothenburg (sic), fired her cannon to salute London at Tower Bridge,” states the BBC article.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/thefabulousweirdtrotter/photos/a.108276364007294/120665616101702/?type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/topic/East-India-Company,https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/east_india_01.shtml,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/11/22/fact-check-british-parliament-ban-lipstick-1770-witchcraft/,https://www.facebook.com/thefabulousweirdtrotter/photos/a.108276364007294/120665616101702/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/InterestingSci1/status/1091276224385691648,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6673041.stm?fbclid=IwAR38vPrtKgbpzMmRG6V6IfdHEOxfJOV8SHChQjmu8Gzyew8w_rN3wSupjyE,https://www.soic.se/the-swedish-east-india-company/en,https://www.soic.se/ship-facts/en,https://www.soic.se/the-original-ship/en,https://gotheborg.com/project/lastvoyage.shtml,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6673041.stm?fbclid=IwAR38vPrtKgbpzMmRG6V6IfdHEOxfJOV8SHChQjmu8Gzyew8w_rN3wSupjyE,http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6673041.stm?fbclid=IwAR38vPrtKgbpzMmRG6V6IfdHEOxfJOV8SHChQjmu8Gzyew8w_rN3wSupjyE,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8acaabdaeb7aa98bcb9b1b4a1bbb9b4b4bdaaf6bbb7b5",Does This Photo Show A 282-Year-Old British East India Company Merchant Ship?,,,,,

Fact Check:   The internet is replete with misinformation about consumer products. In this particular case, the meme makes a dubious claim about PepsiCo production of Mountain Dew, a popular soft drink. (RELATED: Hoax Claims That Pepsi Products Are Infected With HIV)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Due to the increased evidence of drinking our line of Mtn Dew (sic) products has been shown to adversely affect health over long periods of use, we have decided to discontinue production of these products,” the post credits PepsiCo Chief Product Officer Niwrad Eiknarf with saying. “Production will cease as of June 31, 2020 and availability will be limited to stock on hand until it is deplenished.” However, the Caller didn’t find media reports of parent company PepsiCo cancelling the Mountain Dew product line. There isn’t any mention of such action in PepsiCo’s 2019 proxy statement or other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. PepsiCo hasn’t published a press release announcing the move either. Further adding to the post’s dubiousness, PepsiCo details its executive officers on its corporate leadership page, and chief product officer is not one of the positions listed there. Eiknarf appears to be a fictional character. Kristen Mueller, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, told the Caller that the post was “not true whatsoever.”  The Centers for Disease Control recommends limiting consumption of soft drinks and other sugar-sweetened beverages. Frequent intake of these drinks can increase the risk of contracting a number of negative health conditions, including obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, according to the Harvard School of Public Health.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJonathan FontiFact Check ReporterFollow Jonathan on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The Animal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) determined it is safe for pets. This claim has been routinely debunked over the years as a hoax. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral Facebook post contains a story about a german shepherd that died of liver failure after licking Swiffer WetJet cleaning solution from its paws. Two cats also died from the same cause, it claims. “He called the company to ask what the contents of the cleaning agent are and was astounded to find out that antifreeze is one of the ingredients,” states the post. “Actually he was told it’s a compound which is one molecule away from antifreeze.” The Swiffer WetJet cleaning solution does not contain any antifreeze or antifreeze-like compounds, per its material safety data sheet. It mostly comprises of water, but also contains small percentages of propylene glycol n-propyl ether or propylene glycol n-butyl ether. These compounds have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use around humans and animals, according to Mercury News. Procter & Gamble, the company that manufactures Swiffer WetJet systems, states that its cleaning products are safe for pets on its website. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show A Dog Former NFL Player Michael Vick Abused?)  “These ingredients are safe to use around pets when used according to label directions and would not cause liver damage at these concentrations,” writes the ASPCA on its website.

Spokespeople from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Fox News debunked the claim in emails to the Daily Caller. Fact Check: A viral post making the rounds on Facebook falsely alleges Fox News changed its accreditation from “news” to “entertainment,” suggesting the cable news network took such action so that its reporting doesn’t have to contain facts.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “They have changed their accreditation to ‘entertainment.’ They legally don’t have to provide any facts in their reporting,” reads the post. “Fox News is in the same category as ‘Saturday Night Live,’ ‘Laugh-In,’ and ‘Swamp People.’ You don’t have to believe me, look it up yourself.” There is, however, no regulatory agency that assigns accreditations to media organizations. The FCC does regulate licensing and over-the-air broadcasts, according to its website, but it doesn’t require media organizations to categorize themselves in such a manner. “This claim is false,” an FCC spokesperson said in an email to the Caller. “The FCC does not have any rules or licensing requirements in which a cable channel might categorize itself as news vs. entertainment.” Carly Shanahan, a Fox News spokeswoman, also told the Caller in an email that the post’s claim was false. (RELATED: No, Fox News Didn’t Stage A Photo Of Trump Visiting Troops In Afghanistan)  Snopes reported that Free Wood Post, a parody news website, published a satirical article about Fox News changing its accreditation from “news” to “satire” in 2013.

Qasem Soleimani in a Jan. 3 drone strike.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The Jamkaran mosque has flown the red flag on several occasions over the past three years. Fact Check: Hundreds of thousands of Iranians participated in processions in Tehran, Qom, and other major Iranian cities to mourn the death of Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s elite Quds Force. Some Iranians also carried red Shiite flags that traditionally symbolize vengeance and unjustly spilled blood, according to The Associated Press.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Jamkaran mosque, a prominent Shiite pilgrimage site the Iranian city of Qom, hoisted a red flag above its turquoise dome Jan. 4, the day after the U.S. killed Soleimani in a drone strike, according to the Times of India. The flag, which bears an Arabic statement roughly translating to “The Avengers of Hussein,” refers to Hussein ibn Ali, Prophet Muhammad’s grandson who died in battle against Sunni Muslims during the 7th century. “It is the first time in history that the red flag has been hoisted on top of the Jamkaran mosque in the Iranian city,” claims the Metro.co.uk article. ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos made a similar claim during a Jan. 5 broadcast of “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.” But, according to a mosque administrator, the Jamkaran mosque has unfurled the red flag on previous occasions. (RELATED: Has Poland Refused To Allow The Building Of Mosques?) Yassine Hossein Abadi, one of the mosque’s administrators, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that the flag has been flown for ten days of mourning during Muharram “for the past three years.” The mosque also displayed the red flag during an Aug. 31 ceremony on the eve of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, according to its website.  “Due to the martyrdom of General Qassem (sic) Soleimani and his comrades, and after hearing the supreme leader calling for a harsh revenge, we unfurled this flag so that all [Shia] believers in the world and all the freedom fighters gather around this flag to avenge Qassem Soleimani’s blood unjustly shed,” Abadi told AFP. On Jan. 7, Iran launched a missile attack against bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of Soleimani, according to The New York Times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/04/iran-unfurls-red-flag-show-ready-war-us-air-strike-12001520/,https://apnews.com/0f0a91eb720021df5e7d1cea1c4b79a3,https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2018/01/03/1615955/jamkaran-one-of-the-primary-significant-mosques-in-the-city-of-qom-iran,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/suleimani-killing-reasserts-trumps-maximum-pressure-policy-to-get-tehran-to-mend-its-ways/articleshow/73104245.cms,https://apnews.com/7f08c8980a6b4eef93fc4911f537292c,https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/04/iran-unfurls-red-flag-show-ready-war-us-air-strike-12001520/,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-20-mike-pompeo-sen-chuck-schumer/story?id=68076280,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/21/fact-check-poland-mosques-saudi-arabia-churches/,https://factcheck.afp.com/no-red-flag-revenge-was-not-raised-first-time-iran-mosque,https://theculturetrip.com/middle-east/articles/the-islamic-new-year-what-is-muharram/,http://www.jamkaran.ir/172120/%d8%a2%db%8c%db%8c%d9%86-%d8%aa%d8%b9%d9%88%db%8c%d8%b6-%d9%be%d8%b1%da%86%d9%85-%d9%85%d8%b3%d8%ac%d8%af-%d9%85%d9%82%d8%af%d8%b3-%d8%ac%d9%85%da%a9%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%af%d8%b1-%d8%a2%d8%b3%d8%aa/,https://factcheck.afp.com/no-red-flag-revenge-was-not-raised-first-time-iran-mosque,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/world/middleeast/iraq-iran-missiles.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b2c6c0d7c4ddc0f2d6d3dbdecbd1d3deded7c09cd1dddf",Did The Jamkaran Mosque In Iran Raise A Red Flag Of Revenge For ‘The First Time In History’?,,,,,

It has been available online since at least July 2016. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Wildfires have raged across Australia since September, killing at least 28 people and burning more than 17.9 million acres. Natural causes, like lightning strikes, have started many of the fires, while humans have accidentally or intentionally started others, according to Newsweek. A viral post alleges that the image shows the Australian wildfires through the clouds. It has been shared more than 2,800 times. (RELATED: Did Climate Change Cause The California Wildfires?) Contrary to the post’s claim, the image doesn’t actually capture one of the more than 100 Australian fires currently burning. The photo, found on the Best Photos Web webpage, depicts a sunset somewhere over Australia, according to its caption. It was posted on that website July 26, 2016, roughly three years before the start of Australia’s current bushfire season. “36,000 feet, SUNSET! Somewhere over Australia,” reads the caption.  This isn’t the first time social media users have used miscaptioned photos to raise awareness for the Australian wildfires. Earlier this month, the Daily Caller debunked a photo of a koala that had allegedly been rescued from the fires by a golden retriever.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2954676627898630&set=a.173609676005353&type=3&theater,https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/01/australia/australia-fires-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html,https://www.newsweek.com/australia-wildfires-arson-new-south-wales-police-1480733,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2954676627898630&set=a.173609676005353&type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2017/12/15/fact-check-did-climate-change-cause-the-california-wildfires/,https://bestphotosweb.wordpress.com/2016/07/26/36000-feet-somewhere-over-australia/,https://bestphotosweb.wordpress.com/2016/07/26/36000-feet-somewhere-over-australia/,https://checkyourfact.com/2020/01/09/fact-check-viral-image-baby-koala-rescued-australian-wildfires-golden-retriever-dog/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#067274637069744662676f6a7f65676a6a63742865696b",Does This Photo Show Australian Fires From Above?,,,,,

Verdict: False There is no evidence the incident ever happened. Boosie debunked the claim on his Instagram. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The story shared on Facebook stated that Boosie, a rapper formerly known as Lil Boosie, recognized Zimmerman outside of a Miami Walmart and called Zimmerman out for his role in Martin’s death, leading to a physical altercation in which both sustained injuries. “Boosie is currently in custody and will appear before a judge for assault charges next week,” reads part of the post. (RELATED: ‘Book Of Yeezus’ — Did Kanye West Publish A Bible That Replaces ‘God’ With His Name?) Instagram user My Mix Tapez first shared the story, according to the New York Post and Heavy.com. The image shared on Facebook features a screen grab of that account’s post. However, the story appears to have no merit. No media outlets reported on the alleged physical altercation. If Zimmerman had gotten into a scuffle with Boosie, it would have been picked up by the media, as both are public figures to varying extents.  Boosie, whose real name is Torrence Hatch, later posted a video on his official Instagram account denying that the altercation ever took place. “Service announcement from Boosie. I never seen George in my life but on TV. This is a lie. Leave me alone,” Boosie said. “I never seen George Zimmerman in my life. George don’t know me. Talking about I did something to him in Walmart, that is a lie.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Zimmerman has made headlines a number of times since his 2013 acquittal of killing Martin. He filed a $100 million lawsuit in December 2019 against Florida prosecutors, Martin’s family and others, alleging that a key witness in the trial was “an imposter,” according to ABC News. An attorney for Zimmerman did not respond to a request for comment.

Ilhan Omar “threatened” to send shawarma to Republican members of Congress to “give them a taste of her culture.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Share to say arrest her now!” reads part of the caption. Verdict: False The Daily Caller found no evidence Omar ever made such a threat to her Republican colleagues. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Social media websites are replete with misinformation about politicians. In this case, the meme makes a dubious claim about Omar, one of three Muslims now serving in Congress. An iteration of this particular claim has been shared on Facebook more than 146,000 times. “Musslamic (sic) Democrat, Ilhan Omar, has threatened members of Congress,” claims the post. “She’s told several Republicans that she’ll send them ‘shawarma’ to ‘give them a taste of her culture.'” (RELATED: Did Ilhan Omar Vote Against Making Female Genital Mutilation A Felony?) However, the Caller didn’t find any media reports of Omar threatening to send her Republican colleagues shawarma, a popular Middle Eastern dish containing meat shaved off a vertical rotisserie. Neither her social media accounts nor ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets have any mentions of the dish either. The claim likely originated as a piece of satire. America’s Last Line of Defense, a widely known satirical content producer, and other parody news pages have shared the meme on Facebook in recent months. Bustatroll.org has also previously included shawarma in satirical articles about Omar.  Omar’s office did not respond to a request for comment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Its disfigurement and abuse was not related to Vick, according to the photographer. Fact Check: Vick, a former NFL quarterback, pleaded guilty to federal and state charges in a dogfighting investigation in 2007 and 2008, respectively. He was sentenced to 23 months in federal prison but got released early, according to ESPN.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral Facebook post allegedly shows a pit bull that Vick disfigured for dogfighting purposes. The image has been shared more than 40,000 times. (RELATED: Did Jimmy Fallon Say, ‘Lindsey Graham Is The Closest Thing Trump Has Come To Owning A Dog’?) “Just Incase (sic) you forgot, Michael Vick removed this dog’s lips to make him look more aggressive to other dogs,” reads the caption. “He murdered 250+ dogs for entertainment and profit. So next time you say ‘he did his time he’s an NFL hero,’ or ‘it was part of his upbringing or culture’ I want you to really think carefully before you say it around me.” Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that Mike Bizelli, a St. Louis-based photographer, took the photo in July 2009. Rescuers removed the female pit bull, Fay, from a property near Hannibal, Missouri, during one of the largest dogfighting busts in history, according to Bizelli. “This is two years past the Vick case,” Bizelli told the Caller in an email. “Vick had nothing to do with Fay.”  According to his 2007 federal plea agreement, Vick does not appear to have participated in any dogfighting activities in Missouri. He participated in dogfighting-related activities in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, New York and New Jersey. It’s unclear how many dogs died during his Virginia-based Bad Newz Kennels’ operation but, according to Vick’s federal plea agreement, Vick or his associates executed at least 15 dogs. Authorities rescued 47 dogs from the property in 2007, reported the Washington Post.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Dogs Deserve Better, an animal welfare nonprofit, purchased Vick’s property in 2011, turning it into a rehabilitation center for abused and neglected canines, according to its website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157282594796443&set=a.48243746442&type=3&theater,https://aldf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/vick_federal_indictment.pdf,https://www.animallaw.info/sites/default/files/pbusvavick_state_plea.pdf,https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=4183786,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157282594796443&set=a.48243746442&type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/10/fact-check-jimmy-fallon-lindsey-graham-dog-donald-trump-kimmel/,https://www.bizelliphotography.com/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3127682940582036&set=pcb.3127710263912637&type=3&theater,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-americas-biggest-dog-fighting-bust/,https://aldf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/vick_federal_indictment.pdf,https://aldf.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/vick_federal_indictment.pdf,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/sports/michael-vick-dogfighting-dogs/,https://dogsdeservebetter.org/about-us,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#03777166756c714367626a6f7a60626f6f66712d606c6e",Does This Photo Show A Dog Former NFL Player Michael Vick Abused?,,,,,

Verdict: False The five men pictured died in a December 2013 helicopter crash in southern Afghanistan. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Featured in the meme are photos of five American servicemen who the post claims died in a recent helicopter crash. The meme, posted Jan. 6, has been shared more than 31,000 times on Facebook. (RELATED: Is Trump Moving 15,000 Troops From Iraq And Afghanistan To The US-Mexico Border?) “These are the five men that died in a helicopter crash this Tuesday in Afghanistan,” reads the post. “Fill your news feed with dedications to them, as they were fighting for our country. For their families we should pray.” There is, however, no record of American soldiers dying in helicopter crashes around the time that the meme got posted, according to iCasualties, a website that tracks military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan. The most recent fatal American military helicopter crash in Afghanistan happened on Nov. 20, 2019, when two soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division died. The men pictured in the image – Chief Warrant Officer 2 Joshua Silverman, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Randy Billings, Sgt. 1st Class Omar Forde, Sgt. Peter Bohler and Spc. Terry Gordon – actually died in a helicopter crash Dec. 17, 2013, according to Stars and Stripes. Another soldier, Staff Sgt. Jesse Williams, was also killed in that 2013 crash but does not appear in the meme.  Their Black Hawk helicopter went down in Afghanistan’s Zabul Province after being blasted by an improvised explosive device, per an Army report about the crash. The Department of Defense identified five of the soldiers who died as members of the 1st Infantry Division and one as a member of the 2nd Cavalry Division. A seventh soldier survived the crash. Despite the meme being outdated, it has circulated widely online since the U.S. killed Iranian Gen.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Two military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq came under missile attack from Iran Jan. 7. Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said they fired the missiles in retaliation against the U.S. for the killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in a Jan. 3 drone strike, according to The New York Times. A viral post falsely alleges that three images show Iranian missiles from that Jan. 7 attack either being launched or hitting a target. The post has been shared more than 14,000 times. (RELATED: Do Saudi Arabia And Its Allies Spend 8 Times More Than Iran Militarily?) Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the top photograph actually shows several ballistic missiles fired by Iran into Syria. The IRGC released the photo of three missiles launching simultaneously Oct. 1, 2018, according to the Military Times. The bottom-left image doesn’t show missiles from the Jan. 7 attack against bases housing U.S. service members in Iraq either. The photo, which Iran’s state TV made available to the European Pressphoto Agency, appears to show a June 2017 Iranian missile attack on an Islamic State-controlled town in Syria, according to The Guardian.

Verdict: False The image is actually a digital visualization of wildfire hotspots based on NASA data. An Australian photographer, not NASA, created the image. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Australians have been battling wildfires across the country since September 2019, with the states of New South Wales and Victoria being the most severely affected. The fires have killed at least 28 people and, in New South Wales alone, damaged or destroyed more than 2,000 homes, reported CNN. A number of social media users have shared alleged images of the wildfires in an effort to raise awareness for the ongoing natural disaster. One image circulating widely on Facebook claims to show a NASA photograph of the Australian wildfires taken from space. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller News Foundation discovered the supposed satellite image does not come from NASA but rather Anthony Hearsey, a Brisbane-based photographer and graphic designer. He created the digital image and posted it on Instagram Jan. 5. “This is a 3D visualisation (sic) of the hotspots in Australia. NOT A PHOTO. Think of this as a graph,” Hearsey wrote on Instagram. “Also note this was created as an art piece.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A Baby Koala Rescued From The Australian Wildfires By A Golden Retriever)  Hearsey used NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management Systems (FIRMS) data from Dec. 5, 2019, to Jan. 5, 2020, to create the digital visualization, per his website. FIRMS tracks wildfires around the world in near real-time. “Scale is a little exaggerated due to the render’s glow, but generally true to the info from the NASA website,” Hearsey states on his website. “Also note that NOT all the areas are still burning, and this is a compilation.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Qasem Soleimani “because Adam Schiff ‘spent the last year on impeachment.'”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Oh, c’mon,” reads the Facebook post. Verdict: False McCarthy’s statement suggested that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s critical tweet was the result of “Schiff’s focus on impeachment instead of intelligence,” per a spokesman from McCarthy’s office. It did not suggest a causal link between Trump ordering the drone strike and Schiff holding impeachment hearings. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    During a Jan. 7 appearance on “Fox and Friends,” McCarthy discussed the latest developments in impeachment and the U.S.’s killing of Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force. He also responded to Schiff’s tweet criticizing Trump for ordering the drone strike that killed Soleimani. “You know what? He’s the chairman of the Intel committee,” said McCarthy. “Maybe had he spent the last year working on that, trying to protect us from what was happening in Iran – from the bombing of the tankers, Saudi Arabia, taking down our drone – instead of taking that committee and making it impeachment, he would never have made that comment.”  Schiff tweeted his criticism of Trump’s move Jan. 6, just a day before Iran launched retaliatory missile attacks on two military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. Other politicians, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, have also criticized Trump for the drone strike.   A dangerous and provocative decision to target a top Iranian official for killing. Threats to bomb cultural sites and use disproportionate force. These are the acts of a President with no functional national security process. Congress must engage with hearings and constraints. https://t.co/eKZrgvfoxx — Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) January 6, 2020  “A dangerous and provocative decision to target a top Iranian official for killing. Threats to bomb cultural sites and use disproportionate force,” wrote Schiff. “These are the acts of a President with no functional national security process. Congress must engage with hearings and constraints.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Raw Story published an article Jan. 7 with the headline that reads, “Kevin McCarthy claims Trump killed Iranian general because Adam Schiff ‘spent the last year on impeachment.'” The story claims that Trump wouldn’t have ordered the drone strike that killed Soleimani if Schiff had not pursued impeachment. But, according to a spokesman from McCarthy’s office, the article mischaracterizes the House minority leader’s statement. “House Democrats are more worried about removing President Trump from office than they are about removing terrorists from the face of the earth,” said Mark Bednar, McCarthy’s communications director, in an email to the Caller. “Leader McCarthy told Fox & Friends that had Chairman Schiff actually used his committee for intelligence instead of impeachment, he wouldn’t have issued that negative comment about President Trump’s decisive action against Soleimani.” McCarthy’s statement did not draw a causal link between Trump ordering the drone strike and Schiff holding impeachment hearings. Bednar appears to suggest McCarthy implied Schiff was unaware of the threat Soleimani posed because he focused on impeachment rather than intelligence in his capacity as the chair of the House Intelligence Committee. The House minority leader emphasized later in the “Fox and Friends” interview that Trump ordered the drone strike because Soleimani posed a threat to the U.S. “The one thing I have a clear understanding, this man has killed more than 600 Americans. This man had continued to rise throughout the region, create problems not only for us but the rest of the world,” McCarthy said. “The world is safer today because this president took action, and he stopped something from creating in the future.” Soleimani was “actively developing plans” to attack U.S. diplomats and service members in the region, according to a statement from the Pentagon.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Marin has discussed the idea of instituting a four-day work week or six-hour work days in the past, but the Finnish government has no current plans to institute such a policy, per a government spokeswoman. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Sun put out an erroneous report Jan. 6 crediting Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin with championing the shorter work week plan. Other outlets, like Seven News and ABC7, also published similar articles this week, though those have since been updated. “FINLAND is introducing a FOUR-DAY working week and SIX-HOUR days under a massive reform by the world’s youngest prime minister, Sanna Marin,” wrote The Sun reporter Les Steed. “The 34-year-old’s reform will let workers spend more time with family and enjoy their lives, culture and hobbies.” Contrary to The Sun’s article, neither Marin nor the Finnish government plan to reduce the average working time for full-time employees to four six-hour days. The Finnish government debunked this claim on Twitter Jan. 7.  In the Finnish Government´s program there is no mention about 4-day week. Issue is not on the Finnish Government’s agenda. PM @marinsanna envisioned idea briefly in a panel discussion last August while she was the Minister of Transport, and there hasn’t been any recent activity. — Finnish Government (@FinGovernment) January 7, 2020   “In the Finnish Government’s program there is no mention about 4-day week,” reads part of the tweet. “Issue is not on the Finnish Government’s agenda.” Pirita Ruokonen, a special adviser to the Finnish prime minister, told the Daily Caller that Marin floated the idea of Finland some day adopting either a four-day work week or six-hour work days at a Social Democratic Party event panel in August.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “However, this was more of a future vision and a potential future goal for the SDP (who has also in the past played a key role in reducing working hours) than something concrete for the near future,” Ruokonen said in an email to the Caller. “These proposals haven’t been and are not official government policy nor are included in the government’s policy programme (sic).” It was also at this event marking the Finnish Socialist Democratic Party’s 120th anniversary that Marin, then the minister of transport and communications, made the comment quoted in The Sun’s article. “People deserve to spend more time with their families, loved ones, hobbies and other aspects of life, such as culture,” The Sun quoted Marin as saying. “This could be the next step for us in working life.” Marin also discussed shorter work weeks on Twitter Aug. 19, just days after floating the idea at that event.

A 4-day week or a 6-hour day with a decent wage may be a utopia today, but may be true in the future.” Reports that Marin’s government was set to introduce four six-hour work days may have originated with a since-revised Jan. 2 article from New Europe, a Belgian newspaper. That story noted Marin mentioned the idea in August 2019 but had been silent on it since becoming prime minister. Zoi Didili, the author of the New Europe article, told The Associated Press that she relied on a translation from original Finnish news sources that, among other details, wrongly claimed Marin suggested the work week changes together. “The basis of the story was that we wanted to see whether the Finnish prime minister would uphold her earlier views,” Didili told The Associated Press. “This time we fell into the trap of not cross-checking this information properly.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10679311/finland-introduce-four-day-working-week-six-hour-days-prime-minister-sanna-marin/,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10679311/finland-introduce-four-day-working-week-six-hour-days-prime-minister-sanna-marin/,https://7news.com.au/business/finlands-prime-minister-sanna-marin-to-introduce-four-day-six-hour-working-week-c-636806,https://web.archive.org/web/20200107095641/https://abc7.com/society/finland-prime-minister-to-implement-4-day-workweek/5819621/,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10679311/finland-introduce-four-day-working-week-six-hour-days-prime-minister-sanna-marin/,https://twitter.com/FinGovernment/status/1214523278515195907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1214523278515195907&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fabc7.com%2F5819621,https://twitter.com/MarinSanna?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/FinGovernment/status/1214523278515195907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/FinGovernment/status/1214523278515195907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1214523278515195907&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fabc7.com%2F5819621,https://twitter.com/piritaruo?lang=en,https://www.facebook.com/sosialidemokraatit/videos/374360456581732/?__tn__=kCH-R&eid=ARAcrPTdx7xMAmQnZ6C5670LZDjPjektGw0rVhi-Hy_dbbif3WhWX9utgLjzjSmH30i6wAY1CDsgduyC&hc_ref=ARTzusqDESBC6pANy9mDBqhzq1xdUDsiFbwy896CAEAC4VBzh3UWxWxHW9yKmAvGABc,https://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/16663-marin-floats-idea-of-a-four-day-24-hour-work-week.html,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10679311/finland-introduce-four-day-working-week-six-hour-days-prime-minister-sanna-marin/,https://twitter.com/MarinSanna/status/1163372847894544384,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/06/01/fact-check-europe-us-trade/,https://twitter.com/MarinSanna/status/1163372847894544384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/MarinSanna/status/1163372847894544384,https://www.neweurope.eu/article/finnish-pm-marin-calls-for-4-day-week-and-6-hours-working-day-in-the-country/,https://apnews.com/3da3c091157da9e88ce2dfcaacbce9eb,https://apnews.com/3da3c091157da9e88ce2dfcaacbce9eb,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#40343225362f32002421292c3923212c2c25326e232f2d",Is Finland Introducing 4-Day Work Weeks And 6-Hour Work Days?,,,,,

The World Wildlife Fund in Australia estimates that as many as 1.25 billion animals have been killed directly or indirectly by the fires, according to USA Today.

The koala’s rescue, McKinnon told The Associated Press, was not related to the wildfires.  “I think the baby koala fell out of his mum’s pouch and didn’t know what to do,” McKinnon told News.com.au. “He would have just wandered over to our back porch and seen the dogs in their beds, then decided to snuggle in Asha’s fur because it’s nice and warm.” The temperature in Strathdownie fell to around 41 degrees Fahrenheit the morning that McKinnon found the koala cuddling her dog, Asha, for warmth, according to CBS News. McKinnon told News.com.au that the koala “never would have made it through the night” if it hadn’t found her dog.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  She gave the koala to a special caretaker until it could be released back into the wild, according to Insider.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False New Hampshire State Rep. Fred Doucette actually wrote an extremely similar statement as a letter to a local newspaper last year. The statement may have gotten linked to Eastwood after the Massachusetts Republican Party shared Doucette’s letter with a meme featuring Eastwood’s likeness. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral Facebook post credits Eastwood, an actor-director known for films such as “American Sniper” and “Gran Torino,” with authoring a long statement supporting Trump. It has been shared more than 12,000 times. “I love when people call Trump Stupid,” reads the beginning of Eastwood’s alleged statement. “You mean the multi-billionaire who kicked every Democrats (sic) butt, buried 16 career Republican politicians, and continues to make fools out of once reputable news organizations.” However, there’s no evidence Eastwood ever actually said or wrote the long statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. No credible sources link it to him online, and Eastwood doesn’t appear to have any social media accounts, per a tweet from his daughter Morgan.  STOP POSING AS MY DAD EVERYONE KNOWS HE WOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA https://t.co/TPX0dF5Dil — Morgan Eastwood (@MorganEastwood) November 9,    “Stop posing as my dad,” she tweeted in 2016. “He would not know how to use social media.” (RELATED: ‘Why I Stick My Neck Out For Trump’ – Did Clint Eastwood Author This Pro-Trump Statement?) Through a quick internet search, the Daily Caller discovered that a nearly word-for-word statement actually comes from Doucette, a Republican New Hampshire state representative and Trump’s campaign chair for the state. He wrote it as a September 2019 letter to the Eagle-Tribune, a newspaper that circulates in parts of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  It’s possible that social media users linked it to Eastwood after the Massachusetts Republican Party shared Doucette’s letter on its Facebook page with a meme that quotes Eastwood as saying, “If Congress really gave a rat’s ass about the American people, they would resign.” The Caller didn’t find any record of Eastwood making the statement about Congress either.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The Russian billionaire appears to be a made-up character. Fact Check:  A widely-shared post purportedly shows a screen grab of a news article about a Russian billionaire, identified as both Vladist and Vladir Sugarin, who offered a billion dollars to James and Williams to have a “super athlete” child. The headline reads, “White Billionaire Offers $1 Billion to Breed Lebron (sic) & Serena.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “LeBron makes hundreds of millions. Serena makes hundreds of millions,” one post credits Sugarin with saying. “Their super baby will make billions.” (RELATED: Did LeBron James Wear A ‘Same Crime’ Protest T-Shirt?) There is, however, no evidence that the financial offer described in the screen grab ever actually happened. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any credible report corroborating the story. Sugarin, who Forbes does not list on its “World’s Billionaires” ranking, seems to be a fictional character. The story, previously debunked by Snopes, appears to have originated on Cream Bump Daily, a now-defunct parody news website that described itself as producing “satirically funny news.” Yet, while Cream Bump Daily clearly disclaimed that it was satire, numerous social media users and online blogs fail to make the same disclosure. They portray the story as factual.  Variations of this claim have been circulating since at least 2016, according to Snopes.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 19,000 times, features a text message that says, “Someone complimented you!” The text message also encourages recipients to click the iOS and Android links. “Attention all girls if you get this do not click the link its (sic) a sex trafficking site that puts a tracker on your phone,” reads the caption. “Girls are going missing this is not a joke.” (RELATED: Are Human Traffickers Putting Zip Ties On Windshield Wipers To Distract Victims?) The links in the pictured text message redirect to the Apple and Android mobile application store pages for a social app called IRL, not a sex trafficking site. IRL, which stands for “in real life,” allows users to “send and receive invites to hang out with friends in real life,” according to its frequently asked questions page. Users can invite others to join the app and send virtual compliments via text message. “IRL is designed to allow communications only between people who know each other and have each other’s phone number,” an IRL spokesperson told WUSA 9.  The Daily Caller didn’t find any media reports of sex traffickers using IRL to track the locations of potential victims either, only numerous media outlets debunking that claim. Spokespeople for IRL have also addressed the claim on several occasions. “The claims are absolutely false,” an IRL spokesperson told WUSA 9. “We have not had any reports of sex traffickers on our app or targeting our users.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Another spokesperson told Snopes that collecting location information is “not even technically possible” when people click on either link in text messages from the app. This isn’t the first time rumors about supposed tactics used by human traffickers to abduct their victims have circulated online. In December 2019, the Caller debunked a viral hoax about traffickers putting zip ties on car windshield wipers to distract women before abducting them.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A statement from the Ohio State athletics department, as well as photos from other games, confirm that he frequently wears a brace on his left ankle. Fact Check:  Ohio State University played Clemson University in the Dec. 28 Fiesta Bowl for a spot in the College Football Playoff national championship game. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Former NFL Players Joe Namath And Al Woodall Kneeling During The National Anthem) Shortly after the game’s broadcast, social media users shared images on Facebook that allegedly show Teague, an Ohio State running back, wearing an ankle monitor on the sidelines. People wear ankle monitors to track their locations, typically as a condition of parole or house arrest.  “Sooo did anyone else notice the Ohio State player with a freaking ANKLE MONITOR ON last night?!?!” reads one such post. Yet, while the black object on his ankle may resemble an ankle monitor at certain angles, there is no evidence Teague wore one during the Dec. 28 game against Clemson. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any media reports of Teague getting arrested or facing legal issues that would warrant an ankle monitor.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “This is simply an ankle brace recommended by our athletic training staff that he has worn all year,” Jerry Emig, an associate athletics director at Ohio State, told the DCNF in an email. Teague, who is currently a freshman, suffered an ankle injury his senior year of high school, according to 247Sports. Photographs from previous games clearly show Teague wearing the brace on his left ankle. Clemson beat Ohio State 29-23 in the Fiesta Bowl to advance to the finals, where Clemson will play Louisiana State University for the championship title Jan. 13.

It’s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Uncle Joe Biden On American Identity,” reads the headline. Verdict: False The video was deceptively edited to suggest Biden made racist remarks. His actual comment was about how he thinks violence against women dates back to English common law. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Biden made a campaign stop in Derry, New Hampshire, Dec. 30, where he discussed topics ranging from health care to gun control to violence against women. Here’s the full video of his campaign stop:  On Jan. 2, a Facebook user shared a short clip from Biden’s speech, with the headline and caption suggesting Biden made a racist remark. (RELATED: How Many Times Has Joe Biden Run For President?)  “Our culture is not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation,” Biden says in the clip. “It’s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture.” Similar videos have been circulating on Twitter: @mooncult, who originally posted it, said Biden “proclaims the ‘European’ identity of America,” while @BethLynch2020 noted “it’s almost like Joe Biden is Racist.” But the 18-second Facebook clip’s claim – that Biden made a racist remark – doesn’t hold up.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The Daily Caller reviewed the entirety of Biden’s nearly 80-minute talk and found that the viral clip has been deceptively edited to remove key context surrounding his comment. It actually comes from Biden’s roughly 13-minute answer to an audience member asking about his “work with women and sexual assault, domestic violence” and his “vision for that in our country.” The former vice president spoke about how, in his view, the U.S. has a “cultural problem” with violence against women stemming from English common law, known as the “rule of thumb,” that he says permitted men to beat their wives to death in the 1300s. This supposed origin of “rule of thumb” phrase has been debunked by numerous researchers. While discussing the difficulty victims face reporting sexual assault on college campuses, Biden circled back to English common law: “Folks, this is about changing the culture, our culture, our culture. It’s not imported from some African nation or some Asian nation,” Biden said. “It’s our English jurisprudential culture, our European culture, that says it’s all right.” The 18-second clip excludes Biden’s sentence about changing culture and cuts off before the ending clause, in which “it” refers to violence against women. The clip deceptively makes it look like Biden made a racist comment that aligns with white nationalist views, when, in actuality, he was talking about how he thinks violence against women dates back to English common law. Biden’s campaign confirmed to The Associated Press that the representation in the edited video was inaccurate.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The real photo actually shows two black men posing in front of a New Black Panther Party flag. Fact Check: An image falsely alleges in a post that Obama is pictured donning a Black Panther uniform and brandishing a pistol in 1998, 10 years before he became the first black president. It has been shared more than 14,000 times on Facebook. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama Tweet, ‘Ask Ukraine If They Found My Birth Certificate’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Taken in 1998. Just 10 short years before becoming president,” reads the caption. “Pease (sic) share this photo of him holding a gun and dressed in a Black Panther uniform. COPY AND SHARE THIS!!! IT WILL BE PULLED DOWN SOON!!!! SO SHARE IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE!!!” Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that Obama’s head has been superimposed onto another man’s head. The real image actually shows two men posing with a flag of the New Black Panther Party, a black nationalist group that’s unaffiliated with the Black Panthers. A time stamp in the bottom-right corner suggests that the photo was taken sometime in 1998. The Daily Mail included the undoctored version of picture in an article about Maruse Heath, a former leader of Philadelphia’s New Black Panther Party chapter. Heath, who also goes by King Samir Shabazz, got arrested on a gun possession charge in 2013, according to the article. “At his arraignment Heath’s (pictured left) lawyer told the court that the New Black Panther party is not a violent group, but instead is a vehicle for community service,” reads the Daily Mail’s caption of the photo.  Heath has been cropped out of the doctored version going viral on Facebook. The identity of the man whose face Obama’s likeness has been superimposed onto is unknown. The photoshopped image has been circulating on Facebook since at least 2009, according to Snopes.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot “4 Democrat Senators Are Turning Republican Because They Oppose Impeachment,” reads the headline of the article.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  The story originated on the satire website Bustatroll.org. No senators have changed their party affiliation as a result of impeachment. Fact Check:  The website AR News Room, which appears to republish news from various sources, posted the article on Dec. 21. But the article, titled “4 Democrat Senators Are Turning Republican Because They Oppose Impeachment,” actually originated on Bustatroll.org, a satire website.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Everything on this website is fiction,” reads its “About Us” page. “It is not a lie and it is not fake news because it is not real. If you believe that it is real, you should have your head examined.” (RELATED: No, Fox News Didn’t Stage A Photo Of Trump Visiting Troops In Afghanistan) The satirical article identifies four individuals who have decided to switch parties in the Senate: Jack Layton of Michigan, Christian Clark of Washington, Gordon Campbell of California and Kareem Jabari of New York. Trump’s impeachment spurred them to join the Republican Party, according to the article. Three of the individuals are not U.S. senators but rather former Canadian politicians – Layton served as the leader of Canada’s New Democratic Party from 2003 until his death in 2011, while Campbell and Clark served as the premier of British Columbia from 2001 to 2011 and 2011 to 2017, respectively. Jabari appears to be a fictional character. No U.S. senators have changed parties in response to Trump’s impeachment.  Both articles likely play on the news of New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew’s party switch from Democrat to Republican in the wake of his refusal to vote for the president’s impeachment. Van Drew announced his plans to switch parties Dec. 19, the day after the House voted to impeach Trump on two counts. Though Bustatroll.org has a clear disclaimer noting that it’s a satire website, AR News Room failed to issue a similar warning. It portrays the article as real.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Adam Schiff posing for a photo with dead convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Well well well… Shifty Schiff,” reads the caption. Verdict: False Epstein was photoshopped into the image. The original picture shows Schiff posing with his father. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Epstein, a convicted sex offended, was arrested in July on charges of sex trafficking underaged girls that he was accused of luring to his homes in New York City and Palm Beach, Florida. In August, he was found dead in his Manhattan prison cell in what officials ruled a suicide. Before the allegations came to light, Epstein had an impressive rolodex of rich and powerful friends, including former President Bill Clinton, actor Kevin Spacey and Prince Andrew. President Donald Trump and Epstein were also friends at one point but later had a falling out, according to Trump. Featured in the photo are Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Epstein. The image was shared by multiple users on Facebook, presumably to suggest a link between the two. “Adam Schiff and Jeffrey Epstein,” reads the caption. “Friendship and pedophilia.” (RELATED: Did Trump And Jeffrey Epstein Pose For A Picture With A Young Ivanka?)  Found through a reverse image search, the original image actually shows Schiff sitting on a couch with his father, Ed Schiff, on Nov. 22, 2018. Schiff shared the actual photo on his verified personal Twitter account to wish people a “Happy Thanksgiving” that year.

Ralph Northam said, “You will give up your guns, if you don’t I’ll have the National Guard cut your power, your phone lines, and your internet. Then, if you still refuse to comply I’ll have you killed.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Northam ever saying the statement. It references a viral internet hoax that was previously debunked. Fact Check:  An image falsely alleged in a post that Northam threatened Virginia residents with violence if they don’t hand their guns over to the government. It references a viral internet hoax that the governor plans to use the Virginia National Guard and other drastic measures to confiscate certain types of firearms.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “You will give up your guns, if you don’t I’ll have the National Guard cut your power, your phone lines, and your internet,” the post credits Northam with saying. “Then, if you still refuse to comply I’ll have you killed.” (RELATED: Is Governor Ralph Northam Planning To Cut Off Electricity And Communication Capabilities Ahead Of Gun Confiscation?) The Daily Caller News Foundation rated the claim that Northam plans to cut off electricity and communication capabilities ahead of confiscating guns as false Dec. 30. Both the Governor’s office and the Virginia National Guard made statements debunking it. There is no evidence that Northam ever said the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his verified Twitter accounts didn’t turn up any matches. No credible sources linked the statement to him online either. Alena Yarmosky, the press secretary for Northam’s office, confirmed to fact-checking website Snopes that Northam never made the statement and has not planned gun confiscation raids.  “People who spread lies like this should be ashamed of themselves,” Yarmosky also told Snopes. (RELATED: Does An AR-15 Shoot 10 Bullets A Second?) Northam announced in early November plans to reintroduce eight gun control bills to the state legislature, including universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, among other measures. In response, more than 100 counties, cities and towns in Virginia have declared themselves “Second Amendment sanctuaries” in largely symbolic resolutions, according to The Associated Press.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  While there’s no record of Northam threatening violence against Virginia gun owners, he has said localities could face repercussions if law enforcement officers don’t enforce the gun control bills if they become laws. “There’s not going to be retaliation. That’s not what I’m about. I’m about making Virginia safer,” Northam said Dec. 11, according to WTKR News 3. “If we have constitutional laws on the books and law enforcement officers are not enforcing those laws on the books, then there are going to be consequences, but I’ll cross that bridge if and when we get to it.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The federal government conducts a census every ten years to count the entire U.S. population, including non-citizens and illegal immigrants. Census takers sometimes go door-to-door in neighborhoods to verify addresses, collect survey responses, drop off census materials and conduct quality checks, according to the Census Bureau. The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 1,000 times, claims that robbers are going door-to-door disguised as “officials” from the “Department of Home Affairs” to confirm people have valid identification for the 2020 Census. It features an alleged photo of an “Urgent Community Notice” for Jersey City, New Jersey residents. Through a quick internet search, the Daily Caller discovered that the Census Bureau has debunked this “Urgent Community Notice” as a hoax on its website. “This is a hoax that originated overseas,” reads the Census Bureau website. “The truth is, census employees are in neighborhoods across the country as they prepare for the next year’s census. However, census employees are not asking the public for any identification.”  No valid I.D. is required to take the 2020 Census, and no “Department of Home Affairs” exists within the federal government.

It has been circulating in various forms since at least 2009. A “Congressional Reform Act of 2017” has never been introduced in Congress. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral image alleges in a post that Trump is “asking everyone to forward this email” that contains seven “TRUMP Rules” that appear to fall under an alleged “Congressional Reform Act of 2017.” It has been shared more than 10,000 times. “1. No Tenure/No Pension. A Congressman/woman collects a salary while in office and receives no pay when they’re out of office,” the post continues. “And, no more perks go with them.” “The TRUMP Rules” include requiring members of Congress to participate in Social Security, pay for their own retirement plans, use the same health care system as their constituents and abide by the same laws applied to American citizens. Another rule listed in the post prohibits them from voting for congressional salary increases. A number of points in “The TRUMP Rules” have been previously debunked by FactCheck.org in 2011 and, more recently, in October of this year. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show A ’28th Amendment’ That ‘Hasn’t Been Upheld In Years’)  There is no evidence that Trump has encouraged people to forward this message. The Daily Caller didn’t find any instances of him tweeting about a “Congressional Reform Act” in the Trump Twitter Archive. An internet search didn’t turn up any credible media outlets reporting on “The TRUMP Rules” either. A search of all legislation introduced in Congress since 2017 revealed that the “Congressional Reform Act of 2017” has never been proposed. Republican Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher did introduce the Congressional Pension Reform Act in 2017, but that bill only dealt with the pension system.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  According to PolitiFact, iterations of the “Congressional Reform Act” have been circulating online since at least 2009, when a chain email first credited billionaire investor Warren Buffett with asking people to forward a proposed constitutional amendment that contained similar language.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In early October, Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria, ahead of a Turkish military incursion into the area. The withdrawal, some have noted, largely abandoned the U.S.’s Kurdish allies in the region. A viral image, shared more than 700 times, allegedly depicts a Syria boy wrapped in a red-and-white blanked sleeping between the graves of his parents. The Facebook post uses the image to criticize supporters of President Donald Trump, presumably for the president’s decision to withdrawal those troops. “Why would any Trump supporters calling themselves Christians ever bother going to church when they are aiding and abetting treason, genocide, mass murder, and ethnic cleansing, unless it’s to ask for forgiveness or it’s all perfectly ok with Republican Jesus!” reads the caption. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller discovered that the photograph does not, in fact, show what the Facebook post claims. The image, taken by Saudi photographer Abdul Aziz al-Otaibi in Saudi Arabia, is actually a staged photo from a 2014 art project. Al-Otaibi posted the photo on his Instagram Jan. 7, 2014.  “I had the idea to make a project whereby I show in pictures how the love of a child for his parents is irreplaceable,” al-Otaibi told Dutch journalist Harald Doornbos in 2014. “Of course I would never ever put a child between two real graves.” The child in the photograph is his nephew, who is not an orphan, and the grave were simply piles of stones, according to al-Otaibi.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “It’s not true at all that my picture has anything to do with Syria,” said al-Otaibi. “I am really shocked how people have twisted my picture.” The claim that the picture shows a boy lying between his parents’ graves in Syria originated with Twitter user @americanbad, who tweeted it out with a false caption in 2014, according to India Today.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/JusticeDemocratsFiles/photos/a.1686639021436206/2104200019680102/?type=3,https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/16/house-condemn-trump-decision-remove-syria/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/world/middleeast/turkey-attacks-syria.html?auth=login-email&login=email,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-special-representative-to-syria-says-us-withdrawal-did-nor-prompt-invasion-by-turkey,https://www.facebook.com/JusticeDemocratsFiles/photos/a.1686639021436206/2104200019680102/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/JusticeDemocratsFiles/photos/a.1686639021436206/2104200019680102/?type=3,https://www.instagram.com/p/i4DlXhDoDp/,https://www.instagram.com/p/i4DlXhDoDp/,https://haralddoornbos.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/saudi-photographer-telle-me-this-is-not-syria-its-not-a-grave-and-the-boys-parents-are-not-dead/,https://haralddoornbos.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/saudi-photographer-telle-me-this-is-not-syria-its-not-a-grave-and-the-boys-parents-are-not-dead/,https://haralddoornbos.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/saudi-photographer-telle-me-this-is-not-syria-its-not-a-grave-and-the-boys-parents-are-not-dead/,https://www.indiatoday.in/fact-check/story/photo-viral-boy-sleeping-between-graves-syria-saudi-arabia-1610498-2019-10-17,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b3f392e3d24390b2f2a222732282a27272e3965282426",Does This Photo Show A Boy Sleeping Between His Parents’ Graves In Syria?,,,,,

The Instagram post swaps the word “Trump” out for the word “Hillary” in the quote. Fact Check: Borowitz is widely known for writing “The Borowitz Report,” a weekly satirical column published in The New Yorker. (RELATED: Did Barack Obama Sign A $90 Million Deal With Netflix To Produce A Series ‘About Trump’s Impeachment’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Instagram post, which features a photo of the satirist, alleges that Borowitz made a statement about “stopping Hillary” Clinton. The post has also been widely shared on Facebook. “Stopping Hillary is a short-term solution,” the Instagram post credits him with saying. “The long-term solution – and it will be more difficult – is fixing the educational system that has created so many people ignorant enough to vote for Hillary.” Found through a quick internet search, Borowitz’s original statement actually references her 2016 political rival, Trump. He posted the statement on his verified Facebook page Nov. 4, 2016, four days before the presidential election. The word “Trump” has been swapped for the word “Hillary” in the Instagram post.   Borowitz has spoken critically of Trump in the past. For instance, he performed a comedic stand-up entitled “The Life-Changing Magic of Impeaching Trump” at The New Yorker Festival in Oct. 17. In that talk, he described Trump’s impeachment as a “precious joy” and Trump voters as “idiots.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.instagram.com/p/B56UeFHoz8Q/,https://www.instagram.com/p/B56UeFHoz8Q/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading,https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/30/fact-check-barack-obama-netflix-deal-donald-trump-impeachment/,https://www.instagram.com/p/B56UeFHoz8Q/,https://www.facebook.com/TheREALCloydRivers/photos/bc.AbqrT3vjUQ9PeE-PyWhXRbJ5ool7R9XurwuGFtiaCvEeqYvA0kdOAfxMNJMckdXzRvdgQF7fThC7Fo-I4ohE4ZLI5kiHvzd2iO1fEfy2VY_IhZBBLp_k8KveKZHN5SCYP83hsKBFKAn3F_PtMfT2tWufXsOOrHTX71gLVNdTGbb3PQ/2618567718180263/?type=1&opaqueCursor=AbrrjcOi8z3bMNl7f4UWK5ggThKEt4K_VWKXDJ0XhkJmpLiExhMc3He36xE5K3Bc9quUAidb3EtGGLkECIi9t77jIxo_s5o2aZ4f_lgHeUHQeFuiRH6QaY0Sh83fQNyD4udxSYv_Hiw2LJAKXdE_LVXWSmr4vpxT-XQXB_MDw8Rwkx-o9fyTWQ9SFfe9GtK15kpm9PWPNLowNvRX00F14hvfeq8wpHgQTFEg0rnTRnNB_GVVdsXq0R0-mrSs-ztlRExB32tCYYtwhrklKRDqRdDTKBfzd73uOBhdrLlQutzXJdf57qalOrJZJi1h-WiOR1UGPC_X7JnCX6jROtursIs-o0g5WYMXmtrlH8tVNTlohZ3LvxU-EIkMX7nR6NdcPVDMVLQvnQGgWVdkgyM5SUzosLlYi82kwkSWHameslookb3p8QRNff4lFLEkI9b8P090UUdgZyp2w9eMZQARL0g_IsDPibnJhsY0c4gR8Z5S5HPN7JAcFosKvFI6MfqvyqQHI4y8KUwfQZQi5KdHUii_&theater,https://www.instagram.com/p/B56UeFHoz8Q/,https://www.facebook.com/andyborowitz/posts/10155014297200681?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCgTMMooFdDikfZaEzWsijtDtVmiiA5LliNpSMluuRkCPTTq1p9zT9Bky5yx_VI6N5MfdTb7xjr9uujMuTW9HTvYsFkhVjvRTVlRQvExL28BvvtdTI6ACsBoh-C0RPXRxTsLRUcWQrt1WZ0eiGgwrTRzLbygFwG9TjMrhXo_p_Rlaq_t4uWDEpK-eATTejggKnF1K7PahIXQDCeDX2xgUf3IZ7mGc6eDeLNlmcO6xnpKawW4Pj9Il-lIizc_AZwnKu2ZuxR-kffmeaFAuGe2SwCDF24AMcvq8ipsYoEjiFdnVfkDAxMNgLZHI9OsM_EkC_O8RaiRIbj_g&__tn__=-R,https://www.facebook.com/andyborowitz/posts/10155014297200681?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCgTMMooFdDikfZaEzWsijtDtVmiiA5LliNpSMluuRkCPTTq1p9zT9Bky5yx_VI6N5MfdTb7xjr9uujMuTW9HTvYsFkhVjvRTVlRQvExL28BvvtdTI6ACsBoh-C0RPXRxTsLRUcWQrt1WZ0eiGgwrTRzLbygFwG9TjMrhXo_p_Rlaq_t4uWDEpK-eATTejggKnF1K7PahIXQDCeDX2xgUf3IZ7mGc6eDeLNlmcO6xnpKawW4Pj9Il-lIizc_AZwnKu2ZuxR-kffmeaFAuGe2SwCDF24AMcvq8ipsYoEjiFdnVfkDAxMNgLZHI9OsM_EkC_O8RaiRIbj_g&__tn__=-R,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLB2MrVZAfg,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a7d3d5c2d1c8d5e7c3c6cecbdec4c6cbcbc2d589c4c8ca",‘Stopping Hillary Is A Short-Term Solution’ – Did Andy Borowitz Make This Statement About Clinton?,,,,,

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez only has St. John’s University professor Anthony Pappas challenging her for her congressional seat. ﻿  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Please meme me into office,” reads part of the caption. Verdict: False Federal Election Commission (FEC) records show that 12 people have filed for candidacy in Ocasio-Cortez’s district, including four Democratic challengers. Pappas said he has no intention of running “at the moment.” Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Ocasio-Cortez defeated 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary to represent New York’s 14th congressional district. In the general election, she won 78.2 percent of the votes, according to The New York Times. A viral image falsely alleges in a post that Ocasio-Cortez has only one challenger in upcoming 2020 congressional elections – Pappas, an associate professor at St. John’s University that ran for the Republican Party in 2018. The post has been shared more than 10,000 times. “Hi I’m Anthony Pappas, I’m the only person challenging Alexandra Ocasio Cortez (sic) for congress,” reads the post. “She just bailed out on a debate against me because I’m an economics professor and I would’ve destroyed her socialist position. Please meme me into office.” The FEC website shows 12 individuals have filed for candidacy in New York’s 14th congressional district, which encompasses parts of Bronx County and Queens County. Four candidates, including New York City Councilman Fernando Cabrera and activist Badrun Khan, will face off against Ocasio-Cortez in the Democratic Primary. Jamaican-American businesswoman Sherie Murray and seven other candidates will vie for the Republican nomination, according to the FEC.  Pappas has not filed a statement of candidacy with the FEC for the 2019-2020 time period. Nor has his 2018 campaign’s Facebook page announced his intention to run for office this election cycle. “There are many other people who want the GOP nomination for 2020,” Pappas told a commenter on the page. “So, at the moment I am not running.” (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez And Omar Vote To Take Benefits Away From Seniors?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Ocasio-Cortez has raised approximately $3.4 million dollars so far, with the next closest candidate, former teacher and retired NYPD cop John Cummings raising roughly $425,000, according to FEC records. To date, her Democratic challengers have all reported zero receipts to the FEC. The claim has been circulating online since at least 2018, yet its claim wasn’t accurate then either. Crowley and Elizabeth Perri of the Conservative Party also appeared on the ballot, according to the Washington Post.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Ralph Northam plans to “Cut off electric… telephones… faxes… cellular phones & cellular data, Internet, so #Virginia residents cannot reveal what is happening once gun confiscation begins to take place.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “This needs to go viral…..for the sake of the people in Virginia,” reads the caption. “This is the MO, have alternate comm’s in place and plans for rally points.” Verdict: False The claim originated on a website known for spreading conspiracy theories and hoaxes. Both the Governor’s office and the Virginia National Guard have debunked the notion that Northam plans to confiscate firearms by force. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Reports circulating on the internet in recent weeks have claimed Northam, the Democratic governor of Virginia, plans to confiscate certain firearms by force. The claims come after legislators introduced several gun control measures in the Virginia state legislature in recent months. Virginia Senate Bill 16, introduced in November, proposes a ban on the possession, transport and sale of assault weapons. It expands the state’s definition of assault weapons to include, among other types of guns, semi-automatic rifles and shotguns with revolving cylinders, according to the bill. One image posted on Facebook Dec. 16 features a screen grab of a tweet from @Cindyseestruth, warning Virginia residents that Northam is going to take extreme measures to confiscate those firearms. It has been shared more than 9,500 times. “WARNING… VIRGINIA GOV RALPH NORTHAM SET TO.. Cut off electric… telephones… faxes… cellular phones & cellular data, Internet, so #Virginia residents cannot reveal what is happening once gun confiscation begins to take place,” reads the screen grabbed tweet. “#PrepareYourselves.”  The claim originated in an article posted by the Hal Turner Radio Show, a website run by the Southern Poverty Law Center-designated white supremacist Hal Turner. He’s known for peddling conspiracy theories and hoaxes on his site, making the claim immediately suspect. “Virginia Governor Reportedly Orders Plans To Cut Electric, Phones, Internet For Gun Confiscations!” reads the article’s headline.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “The source is a staffer in Virginia state government who asked for, and was given anonymity for fear of losing their job,” Turner told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email. A number of Twitter bots, including @Cindyseestruth, have reportedly helped promulgate the story on the site, according to data from Hoaxy, a website that tracks bot activity. There’s no evidence that Northam plans to cut off the state’s electricity or suppress communication capabilities to enforce the proposed gun control legislation. Both the governor’s office and the Virginia State National Guard have refuted the notion that he plans to confiscate guns by force. “In this case, the governor’s assault weapons ban will include a grandfather clause for individuals who already own assault weapons, with the requirement they register their weapons before the end of a designated grace period,” said Alena Yarmosky, the press secretary for Northam’s office, in an interview with The Virginia Mercury. Yarmosky also told PolitiFact that the claim was “absolutely false,” adding, “People who spread lies like this should be ashamed of themselves.” The Virginia National Guard, who Turner claims will carry out the confiscation plan, also tweeted that they have received no such requests from the governor to enforce state gun control legislation.  I encourage everyone to be patient while we allow our elected officials to work through the legislative process. We have not received any requests from the Governor, or anyone on his staff, about serving in a law enforcement role related to any proposed legislation. — Va. National Guard (@VaNationalGuard) December 13, 2019   “We have not received any requests from the Governor, or anyone on his staff, about serving in a law enforcement role related to any proposed legislation,” reads the tweet. Statements from both the Governor’s office and the Virginia National Guard contradict Turner’s unreliable sourcing. The DCNF rates the claim as false.

The other photo shows a homeless encampment in Pelosi’s district, it claims.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The house pictured belongs to a limited liability company (LLC) with which Pelosi and her immediate family have no affiliation. The photo of the homeless encampment was taken in Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee’s district. Fact Check: Pelosi currently serves as the representative for California’s 12th congressional district and as the Speaker of the House. She is the first woman in U.S. history to hold the House speaker position.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 73,000 times, attempts to contrast Pelosi’s home to the rest of her district. It features two photographs – one of a large turreted house, the other of what appears to be a homeless encampment – and has a caption that reads, “Nancy’s home… Nancy’s district.” However, neither photograph actually shows what the Facebook post claims. (RELATED: Did Ronald Reagan Call Nancy Pelosi ‘Extremely Evil’?) The top photo, found through a reverse image search, shows a house located at 2724 Pacific Avenue in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco. It is currently owned by 2728 Pacific LLC, according to public records. A legal representative for 2728 Pacific LLC told FactCheck.org that Pelosi and her immediate family have no affiliation with the company. Neither 2728 Pacific LLC nor the turreted house are listed in Pelosi’s most recent financial disclosure.  Pelosi and her husband do own a house in Pacific Heights that they purchased for roughly $2.3 million in 2007, according to public records. That house and other properties, including two commercial buildings in San Francisco, appear in her most recent financial disclosure. The claim that the bottom photo shows Pelosi’s district doesn’t hold up either. The picture, taken by San Francisco Chronicle photographer Santiago Mejia, shows tents housing homeless people near Northgate Avenue and Sycamore Street in Oakland, per its caption. That area is located in California’s 13th congressional district, which has been represented by Lee since 2013.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/kevin.andrews.50596/posts/2882778158419185,https://pelosi.house.gov/about/our-district,https://pelosi.house.gov/biography-0,https://www.facebook.com/kevin.andrews.50596/posts/2882778158419185,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/11/20/fact-check-ronald-reagan-nancy-pelosi-extremely-evil/,https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2724-Pacific-Ave-San-Francisco-CA-94115/2110571049_zpid/,https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2724.pdf,http://www.criis.com/webtemp/71.200.104.106/doc_detail_n.html,https://www.factcheck.org/2018/12/the-house-that-isnt-nancy-pelosis/,http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2017/10020995.pdf,https://cdn.factcheck.org/UploadedFiles/2640.pdf,http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-pdfs/2018/10026982.pdf,https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Kaiser-will-put-200-million-toward-affordable-12924030.php,https://www.santiagomejiaphoto.com/index/G0000mJfDjbichxo,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/CA/13,https://lee.house.gov/about/biography#representative,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8bfff9eefde4f9cbefeae2e7f2e8eae7e7eef9a5e8e4e6",Viral Image Claims To Show Nancy Pelosi’s House And Her Congressional District,,,,,

Verdict: False The Daily Caller didn’t find any recent media reports of Christian missionaries being sentenced to death or executed in Afghanistan. The claim has been routinely debunked over the years as a hoax. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which features a screen grab of a text message, asks people for prayers and urges them to pass the message along to others. It has been shared more than 300 times. (RELATED: Do The Taliban Control Nearly 45 Percent Of Afghanistan?) “Please pray for the 22 Christian Missionaries who have been sentenced to death tomorrow afternoon by the Islamic in Afghanistan,” reads the message. “Can you please pass this news quickly so a lot of people can pray for them.” The State Department estimates that Christian and other non-Islamic religious groups make up less than one percent of Afghanistan’s population. The country’s constitution, which establishes Islam as the state religion, grants minority religious groups freedom to exercise their faiths “within the limits of the law,” but makes proselytizing and apostasy punishable by death, according to the State Department. The Daily Caller didn’t find any recent media reports of 22 Christian missionaries being sentenced to death or executed in Afghanistan, only other fact-checkers debunking the claim as a hoax. According to Snopes, the hoax has been circulating since at least 2009, spreading via text message, email and social media.  One widely-shared version includes an image purportedly showing the execution of a Christian missionary in Afghanistan. However, Agence France-Presse (AFP) determined that the photo likely depicts a member of the Islamic State executing a man accused of spying in Iraq. While the Facebook post’s claim has been routinely debunked as a hoax, there have been cases of the Taliban and other Islamic militant groups killing people accused of being Christian missionaries in Afghanistan. (RELATED: Is The US Spending $50 Billion A Year In Afghanistan?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  In 2010, the Taliban claimed responsibility for killing 10 medical aid workers from the International Assistance Mission, claiming the individuals were Christian missionaries and spies, according to The New York Times. In 2014, the Taliban killed a South African family in Kabul for allegedly operating a secret Christian missionary group, though friends of the family told reporters said they were not proselytizing, according to The Guardian. The Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISKP) has also targeted Christian and other minority religious groups in Afghanistan, according to the State Department.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It has been doctored to make it look like the event was staged. Fact Check:  Trump made an unannounced visit to Bagram Air Base, the main American base north of Kabul, Afghanistan, on Thanksgiving Day. Shortly thereafter, a number of social media users began circulating claims about Fox News staging a photo of the president’s surprise visit.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This Facebook post features an alleged screen grab of a Fox News broadcast showing American soldiers cheering and clapping during this visit. A sign appearing to bear the words “universal,” “national” and “studios” can be seen in the background. “Fox propaganda posts a fake picture to show soldiers excited to see Trump in Afghanistan … forgets to take out the Universal Studios sign in the background,” the Facebook post said. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Soldiers ‘Crying And Visibly Shaken’ Over Trump’s Syrian Withdrawal?) However, the image has been digitally altered. Taken by Agence France-Presse photographer Olivier Douliery, the original picture has no sign visible in the background, just a plain beige wall. The words appear to have been photoshopped into the image. “US Soldiers react with cheers and applause as US President Donald Trump arrives in Bagram Air Field during a surprise Thanksgiving day visit, on November 28, 2019 in Afghanistan,” reads the caption.  “Of course it’s a fake,” Douliery told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email. Fox News told FactCheck.org that it never aired the image. The DCNF also didn’t find any record of Fox News airing it.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Other media outlets, including Axios and the Daily Mail, included the image in their reporting of Trump’s surprise visit.

Rashida Tlaib celebrating President Donald Trump’s impeachment.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The image actually shows Tlaib’s reaction to drawing a lottery number for selecting available congressional office space in November 2018. Fact Check: Featured in the photograph is Tlaib, a freshman congresswoman for Michigan. She appears in a blue dress laughing and holding round piece of paper in her hand.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The viral image started circulating on Facebook after the House voted to impeach Trump on counts of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It suggests that the photograph shows Tlaib celebrating that Dec. 18 impeachment vote. “It was a somber time for the Democrats as they voted to impeach the president,” says the caption. (RELATED: Doctored Photo Disparages Progressive Congresswomen) It does not, however, show the Michigan congresswoman’s reaction to Trump’s impeachment. Taken by photographer Win McNamee Nov. 30, 2018, the photo actually captures the moment after Tlaib drew the number eight lottery ticket during new member orientation, per its caption. Incoming members of Congress draw lottery numbers to determine the order in which they select available congressional office space. On Dec. 18, the House voted on two articles of impeachment against Trump. On the article charging Trump with abuse of power, the House voted 230-197. On the article charging Trump with obstruction of Congress, the House voted 229-198. No Republicans voted for Trump’s impeachment, and three Democrats voted against at least one article. (One of the Democrats, New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew, has said he plans to switch parties.)  Tlaib drew criticism Jan. 3, her first day in office, for saying, “We’re going to impeachment the motherf****r.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The Irtysh River runs 2,640 miles from China through Kazakhstan to Russia’s Siberia region, where it feeds into the Ob River. The rivers together constitute the world’s seventh longest river system. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show A Jaguar Being Rescued From The Amazon Wildfires?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral image falsely alleges in a post that the Irtysh river froze in a formation that resembles the mask in the “Scream” horror movie franchise, with the caption reading, “The Irtysh river in Russia froze over in a very interesting pattern.” The photograph has, in fact, been digitally manipulated. Found through a reverse image search, the original image does not feature holes in the ice that form a ghoulish face but rather a single large gap in the center of the ice. Photographer Andrei Kudryavtsev posted it on his website and the Russian social media website VK.com in March 2012.

So this is the reason for the fake impeachment inquiry!” Verdict: False There’s no record of Pelosi ever saying the quote. It is actually a Fox News correspondent’s characterization of a memo Pelosi sent to Democrats mid November. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The House voted Dec. 18 to impeach Trump on two counts – abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The impeachment vote came months after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. The Facebook post, which features a black-and-white photo of Pelosi, attributes a quote about impeachment to the House speaker. It has been shared more than 8,800 times. “It is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump’s fate,” the Facebook post credits Pelosi with saying. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims That Fox News Isn’t Covering The Mueller Hearings) However, there’s no record of Pelosi ever saying the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. It does not appear in ProPublica’s collection of her public statements released during the 116th Congress. A search of her social media accounts didn’t turn up any instances either.  Mike Emanuel, the chief congressional correspondent for Fox News, actually said the words during a live segment. He was referencing a Nov. 18 open letter to Democrats in which Pelosi discussed impeachment. “House Speaker Nancy Pelosi circulated a memo to Democrats tonight telling them it would be dangerous to let voters decide President Trump’s fate when it comes to the Ukraine investigation,” said Emanuel.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  President Donald Trump tweeted the quote shortly after Emanuel’s segment.  Nancy Pelosi just stated that “it is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump’s fate.” @FoxNews In other words, she thinks I’m going to win and doesn’t want to take a chance on letting the voters decide. Like Al Green, she wants to change our voting system. Wow, she’s CRAZY! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2019  “Nancy Pelosi just stated that ‘it is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump’s fate.’ @FoxNews In other words, she thinks I’m going to win and doesn’t want to take a chance on letting the voters decide,” reads his tweet. “Like Al Green, she wants to change our voting system. Wow, she’s CRAZY!” Emanuel was not directly quoting Pelosi but rather offering his interpretation of the contents of Pelosi’s memo. Trump and some Facebook users appear to have mistaken Emanuel’s characterization of the memo as a direct quote. Here’s what Pelosi actually wrote in her Nov. 18 memo: “The weak response to these hearing has been, ‘Let the election decide.’ That dangerous position only adds to the urgency of our action, because the President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections.” Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, told FactCheck.org that Emanuel’s paraphrasing distorted Pelosi’s actual words and meaning.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

I just hope he never goes into politics. He’d be a disaster.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There’s no record of Mary Anne Trump ever saying the quote. Fact Check:  Mary Anne Trump, an immigrant from Scotland, married Fred Trump in 1936. She had five children with him: Maryanne Trump Barry, Fred Trump Jr., Elizabeth Trump Grau, Donald Trump and Robert Trump.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    An image alleges in a post that Mary Anne Trump made a disparaging remark about Donald Trump. It does not give a citation for the quote making the rounds on social media. “Yes, he’s an idiot with zero common sense, and no social skills, but he IS my son,” the Facebook post quotes her as saying. “I just hope he never goes into politics. He’d be a disaster.” However, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of Mary Anne Trump ever saying the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. A search of news archives and interviews didn’t yield any matches. It only seems to appear in memes and social media posts. Other fact-checkers have also been unable to find any credible sources linking Mary Anne Trump to the quote. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Trump’s Parents Wearing KKK Robes)  If Mary Anne Trump had said such a negative thing about her son before her death in 2000, it likely would have been picked up by the media when Donald Trump publicly considered running for president in the late ’90s, but no news outlets reported on it. The alleged quote didn’t come up during Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign either.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Facebook/Screenshot “They say history repeats itself,” reads the caption.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The image is fake and has been digitally altered.

LaFlamme told that commenter he could no longer find the source image. It also appears on LaFlamme’s website and some meme websites under sections dedicated to altered images.

The 22nd Amendment expressly prohibits presidents from being elected to office more than two times. Fact Check: The House voted to impeach President Donald Trump on counts of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress Dec. 18, making him the third president in history to be impeached. At the time of publication, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 10,000 times, features a screen grabbed tweet that implies Trump could seek two more presidential terms if the Senate does not vote to convict and remove him. (RELATED: Did Vermont Governor Phil Scott Vote To Impeach President Trump?) “The U.S. Constitution states that if a president is impeachment by the House but not convicted by the Senate, that person’s first term is nullified and they are eligible to run for office two more times!!!” reads the tweet. “#Trump2024!” The Constitution outlines the basic process for impeachment: the House has “sole Power of impeachment,” while the Senate has “sole Power to try all impeachments,” according to Article 1. The chief justice of the Supreme Court presides over the trial in the Senate, where two-thirds of present members must vote “yea” to convict and remove the president from office. Contrary to the post’s claim, the Constitution does not state anywhere that a president’s term can be “nullified” if the Senate does not vote to convict on the impeachment charges. The 22nd Amendment explicitly prohibits presidents from getting elected to office more than two terms.  “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of President more than once,” states the 22nd Amendment. Only two other presidents – Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton – have been impeached by the House. Both presidents subsequently got acquitted by the Senate, in 1868 and 1999 respectively, yet neither saw their presidential terms nullified.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Former President Richard Nixon also faced an impeachment inquiry but resigned before the House could voted to impeach him.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157003589914247&set=a.10151602534874247&type=3&theater,https://dailycaller.com/2019/12/18/house-votes-impeach-president-donald-trump/,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-attacks-speaker-pelosi-holds-articles-impeachment/story?id=67916615,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157003589914247&set=a.10151602534874247&type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/DeepStateExpose/status/1204963933649612800,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/02/fact-check-vermont-governor-phil-scott-impeach-trump/,https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript,https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript,https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript,https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xxii,https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendment/amendment-xxii,https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Impeachment_Johnson.htm,https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/impeachment/clinton-impeachment-and-its-fallout,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe8a8c9b88918cbe9a9f9792879d9f92929b8cd09d9193",Viral Image Claims The Constitution Allows The President To Seek Extra Terms If Impeached But Not Removed,,,,,

Fact Check:  Fonda publicly opposed the Vietnam War during the 70s. In 1972, she visited Hanoi, where she made several radio broadcasts imploring U.S. pilots to stop bombing North Vietnam, according to the Washington Post. A well-known photo from that controversial visit shows her sitting on a North Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which contains a number of claims about Fonda that have since been debunked by other fact-checkers, attributes to Walters a statement critical of the actress. It has been shared more than 14,000 times. (RELATED: Was Jane Fonda Denied Service At A Restaurant Run By A Vietnam Veteran?) “Barbara Walters writes: Unfortunately, many have forgotten and still countless others have never known how Ms. Fonda betrayed not only the idea of our country, but specific men who served and sacrificed during the Vietnam War,” reads the beginning of the post. However, there is no evidence Walters ever said or wrote the statement attributed to her in the Facebook post. A Nexis search didn’t turn up any matching or similar statements. No instances turned up on Newspapers.com. Walters did sit down with Fonda in 1988, but the statement doesn’t appear in that interview either. In fact, Fonda actually apologized for her visit to North Vietnam and for posing for the photograph of her sitting on an anti-aircraft gun during the interview, according to an ABC News transcript.  “Jane Fonda told me that she now realizes in her urgent desire to end the war, she unthinkingly caused pain to many Americans who fought in Vietnam,” said Walters. “In our interview tonight, she speaks directly to former prisoners of war, to Vietnam veterans and their families. And confronting her past, she then apologizes.” Fonda also appeared in an ABC News special, entitled “A Celebration: 100 Years of Great Women,” that aired in April 1999. Walters, who hosted the program, also doesn’t appear to have made the statement during that broadcast.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The statement has been circulating in various forms for roughly two decades, according to Snopes.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

However, there’s no record of him making the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The quote about 40,000 people supposedly attending the rally appears in neither the footage nor the transcript of the event. The Daily Caller News Foundation didn’t find any media reports crediting him with the claim either. (RELATED: Did Four Republicans Vote To Impeach Trump?) While he didn’t make the claim that 40,000 people attended the event, Trump did comment on the size of the rally’s crowd.  “And by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave,” said Trump. “You know?

Fact Check: Trump signed a $1.4 trillion spending package Dec. 20 that will fund the federal government through Sept. 30, according to USA Today. Included in the spending package is $25 million earmarked for gun violence research. That earmark comes after a 20-year drought in federal funding for that purpose, according to The Verge.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    UberFacts shared an image Dec. 21 that purportedly shows Trump presumably holding that recently-signed legislation, with his daughter Ivanka, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Chris Liddell and Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios standing around him. The image has been widely shared on Facebook. “President Donald Trump has signed a bill to spend $25 million on gun control research,” claims the post. “The government will be funding studies related to the issue for the first time in over 20 years.” (RELATED: Do Tighter Gun Control Laws Lead To Fewer Gun-Related Deaths?) The photo does not, however, show Trump holding up the $1.4 trillion spending package or any other legislation funding “gun control research.” It actually shows Trump presenting the National Quantum Initiative Act shortly after he signed it Dec. 21, 2018. The law directs the federal government to spend more than $1.2 billion over five years to advance quantum information science technology. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy posted the picture, found through a reverse image search, on its Twitter the same day Trump signed it.  Trump signed the $1.4 trillion spending package Dec. 20 aboard Air Force One as he flew to Palm Beach, Florida, where he spent Christmas with his family at his Mar-a-Lago resort, according to USA Today.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/UberFacts/photos/a.365110753522020/3007589495940786/?type=3&theater,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/20/trump-signs-1-4-trillion-spending-bill-raise-age-tobacco-sales/2666117001/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/20/trump-signs-1-4-trillion-spending-bill-raise-age-tobacco-sales/2666117001/,https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21028779/gun-violence-research-funding-20-year-freeze-congress-bill-cdc-nih-dickey,https://www.facebook.com/UberFacts/photos/a.365110753522020/3007589495940786/?type=3&theater,https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/ivanka-trump/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/chris-liddell/,https://www.whitehouse.gov/people/michael-kratsios/,https://checkyourfact.com/2017/10/03/fact-check-do-tighter-gun-control-laws-lead-to-fewer-gun-related-deaths/,https://twitter.com/WHOSTP/status/1076281895636426755,https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6227,https://www.fedscoop.com/national-quantum-initiative-advisory-committee/,https://twitter.com/WHOSTP/status/1076281895636426755,https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20191216/trump-in-palm-beach-president-expected-to-be-here-for-holidays,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/20/trump-signs-1-4-trillion-spending-bill-raise-age-tobacco-sales/2666117001/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#23575146554c516347424a4f5a40424f4f46510d404c4e",Does This Photo Show Trump Signing A $25 Million ‘Gun Control Research’ Bill?,,,,,

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A Facebook post, which looks vaguely like a news story, describes an incident in which a shopping mall Santa and several elves performed an act of vigilante justice in Wisconsin. It has been shared more than 23,000 times since Dec. 18. (RELATED: Did Tomi Lahren Say ‘Obama Created Festivus To Destroy Christmas’?) “A Wisconsin mall Santa decided to handle one of the naughty list members early this year when a young girl told him her Christmas wish was for her stepdad to stop molesting her,” reads the post. “He and four of his elves attacked the guy, who was waiting nearby, and pummeled him unconscious.” Two images – one showing police officers arresting a man dressed as Santa Claus, the other showing a pixelated portrait of a man – accompany the text in the Facebook post. Below that, the story’s byline credits “Thug Muncher” with authoring the piece, immediately making the story suspect. (RELATED: Hoax Claims That Cadbury Products Were Tainted With HIV-Positive Blood)  The story likely originated on Thug Life Videos, a website that disclaims it “sometimes share[s] the odd satire stories for your entertain.” That article, found through an internet search, placed the vigilante mall Santa incident in a suburban Milwaukee mall, but The Associated Press debunked that version of it in 2016. Found through a reverse image search, the pixelated portrait actually shows a 2012 mugshot of a Florida man caught prowling outside a house that was later posted on the official Facebook page of the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office. The other image, taken on Black Friday in 2013, depicts a protester dressed as Santa getting arrested outside a California Walmart, according to CBS 2 Los Angeles.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The tale of the mall Santa and his elves beating up a child molester has been circulating since at least 2016, according to Snopes.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

A number of vegetable recalls also occurred in 2019.

It has been shared more than 18,000 times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “There hasn’t been a single bacon recall in 2019,” reads the caption. “But there have been several vegetable recalls… Just saying.” (RELATED: Does 40 Percent Of Food In The US Never Get Eaten?) While a number of vegetable product recalls did make headlines this year, it isn’t accurate to say that, in comparison, there wasn’t a single bacon recall. The Daily Caller found five recalls of bacon products in 2019 in the FSIS database. Most recently, the Kentucky-based Blue Grass Quality Meats company recalled more than 121,000 pounds of bacon and ready-to-eat turkey products in late November. They were recalled because they contained soy, an allergen that wasn’t listed on the product labels, according to the FSIS. Earlier in November, Mann Packing announced a voluntary recall of vegetable products over a possible Listeria monocytogenes contamination. Those vegetable products were sold at a variety of grocery stores, including Trader Joe’s, Kroger and Safeway’s Signature Farms, according to Healthline.  The most common cause of food recalls in the U.S. is undeclared allergens, according to Food Safety Magazine.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor

Verdict: False No such law has been introduced. Wildlife poaching is not punishable by the death penalty under Kenyan law. The claim comes from erroneous reporting in a Xinhua news agency article. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Kenya and other African countries have seen their wildlife populations, particularly those of elephants and rhinos, decimated by illegal wildlife poaching, according to The Guardian. The African Wildlife Foundation predicts that elephants, rhinos and several other species may go extinct “within our lifetime” at current poaching rates. The Wildlife Conservation and Management Act of 2013 outlines punishments for various poaching convictions in Kenya. Penalties range from a fine of one million shillings and/or five years’ imprisonment up to a fine of 20 million shillings and life imprisonment, depending on the severity of the crime. The Facebook post alleges that Kenya has introduced legislation that significantly increases the severity of punishment for poaching wildlife, with the caption reading, “Kenya has introduced a law that would institute death penalty for all wildlife poachers regradless (sic) of their nationality.” It has been shared more than 400 times. A quick internet search turned up a number of articles repeating the death penalty claim. Some publications reported that Kenyan Tourism and Wildlife Minister Najib Balala publicly announced the move, even quoting him as saying that existing penalties have “not been deterrence enough to curb poaching.”  Balala’s alleged remarks in these articles originated in a 2018 article published by Chinese news agency Xinhua, according to AFP. That article placed his statement at an event organized by the Postal Corporation of Kenya. Patrick Omondi, the former director of research monitoring and strategic initiative at the tourism ministry, told AFP that Balala did not attend the event. “That is misinformation,” Omondi told AFP. “I was the one reading the minister’s statement at the meeting and I can tell you nothing I spoke on behalf of the minister was related to the death penalty for poachers.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Omondi also told AFP that there are no plans to institute capital punishment for poaching either. (RELATED: Did Trump Say Suicide Bombers Should Get The Death Penalty?) In a phone interview with AFP, Balala did say that current penalties aren’t sufficient considering the damage caused by illegal poaching. “But this does not mean death penalty – that, I assure you, was taken out of context,” said Balala. “We can have the fines increased, longer jail terms and ensure that the poachers do not easily get away by paying fines.” Kenya’s penal code does allow for capital punishment but, according to Reuters, no one has been put to death in the country since 1987. President Uhuru Kenyatta commuted all death sentences in Kenya to life imprisonment in 2016, according to The New York Times. His predecessor, former Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki, did the same in 2009. In 2017, the Supreme Court of Kenya ruled unconstitutional the mandatory sentencing of capital punishment for crimes such as murder, treason and armed robbery, according to the World Coalition Against the Death Penalty.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The claim has been debunked numerous times over the years as an internet hoax. Fact Check: Warnings for women to be cautious if they find zip ties attached to their vehicles are being widely shared on Facebook. (RELATED: Hoax Claims That Pepsi Products Are Infected With HIV)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “My windshield wipers were zip tied together while I was shopping at post oak mall,” reads the caption of one Facebook post. “Law enforcement let me know that this is a trick human traffickers use and when women struggle trying to remove the ties they are abducted.” The International Labor Organization estimates there are more than 40.3 million victims of human trafficking worldwide. Of these trafficked people, approximately 75 percent are girls and women. However, putting zip ties on windshield wipers does not appear to be a widespread tactic used by human traffickers to abduct victims. The Daily Caller didn’t find any credible sources documenting this tactic, only media outlets debunking it. Ayan Ahmed, a spokesperson for the human trafficking-focused NGO Polaris Project, told PolitiFact that most most human traffickers lure victims through psychological means. Human traffickers also more often target people they know than strangers, according to Ahmed.  Post Oak Mall, the shopping center mentioned in the image, is located in College Station, Texas. The local police department addressed the story on their official Facebook page, noting that it’s “extremely unlikely” the tactic has anything to do with human trafficking. “It’s always good to remind people, especially during the busy shopping season, to be aware of their surroundings and to report suspicious activity,” advised the College Station Police Department.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The hoax may have originated in October 2018 when similar claims of zip ties being used by human traffickers in San Angelo, Texas, circulated online. After reportedly receiving multiple inquiries about the viral posts, the San Angelo Police Department put out an official statement about the supposed tactic. “The San Angelo Police Department has not received any reports of human trafficking, kidnappings or attempted kidnappings relating to human trafficking nor have we received any reports of black zip ties being used as a means to mark a target of any type of crime,” reads the statement. “Additionally, our administration has reached out to the Angelo State University Police Department and their administration had confirmed that they have not received any such report.” Other police departments across the country have since dispelled stories of human traffickers using this tactic, according to the Kansas City Star.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The publication distributed the two editions to different markets to manipulate readers, it claims.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The Wall Street Journal printed the two versions with different headlines to meet delivery schedules and to reflect developing news, not to manipulate readers. The one on the left was published before President Donald Trump gave a campaign speech, while the one on the right was published after. The newspapers likely went to distinct geographical areas, as different editions get printed on a distance-based delivery schedule. Fact Check: The Facebook post, which features two editions of the Wall Street Journal that appear to have the same story but opposing headlines, suggests that the publication distributed them to different markets to influence readers. Both newspapers have the same photograph of Trump, the then-Republican presidential candidate, shaking hands with then-Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto on their front-pages.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Trump softens his tone,” reads the headline of the newspaper on the left. The other headline reads, “Trump Talks Tough on Wall.” “Same paper. Same story. Same day. Different regions. Different message,” reads the post’s caption.”Still think you’re not being manipulated by media? Think again…” (RELATED: Was Tulsi Gabbard ‘Labeled’ A ‘Right-Wing Extremist’ By The New York Times?) Colleen Schwartz, the vice president of communications at the Wall Street Journal, told the Daily Caller in an email that the images represent two different editions of the newspaper published at different times to meet distance-based delivery schedules. Both versions of the story appeared in print on Sept. 1, 2016.  “There are different editions of the Journal printed at different times during the evening in order to meet delivery demands,” Schwartz explained in an email. “This often means that the content is updated to reflect new reporting on news and events as they evolve. The different editions are distinguishable by the number of stars in the upper right corner (under the L in Journal).” The edition on the left has two stars, while the edition on the right has four stars. That means the newspaper on the left was printed earlier than the one on the right.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Newspaper editions are printed and distributed to different areas based on how long it takes for the papers to get from the printing plants to their destinations, meaning editions going to areas farther away get printed earlier and those going to closer areas get printed later with more up-to-date news. The newspapers in the Facebook post show two different versions of the same story because the story was still developing after the earlier edition’s print deadline, according to Schwartz. Trump traveled to Mexico City to meet with Nieto on Aug. 31, 2016, according to NPR. He gave a speech at a campaign rally stop in Phoenix later that same day. Both stories in the pictured editions covered these events to varying extents, as well as using the same Reuters picture. (RELATED: Meme Claims El Chapo Testified That He Gave Money To Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi And Adam Schiff) “The edition on the left was published after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto early in the day (and referenced the seemingly cooperative tone of their discussion),” Schwartz told the Caller in an email. “The edition on the right was published after Trump delivered a speech on immigration later in the day (and referenced Trump’s reasserting his stance that he would force Mexico to pay for the building of a wall along the US Mexico border).” “The images represent two different editions, published at different times. The headlines represent the news at the time of the publication – before and after his speech,” added Schwartz. Similar claims about this photograph of the Wall Street Journal editions have been circulating online since 2016, according to Schwartz.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218269414000312&set=a.2105400008137&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218269414000312&set=a.2105400008137&type=3&theater,https://pictures.reuters.com/CS.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&VBID=2C0FCIUVQX3JB&SMLS=1&RW=1305&RH=673&PN=3&POPUPPN=151&POPUPIID=2C0BF1F59DJE2,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/21/fact-check-new-york-times-tulsi-gabbard-right-wing-extremist/,https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleen-schwartz-4796275,https://www.npr.org/2016/08/31/492132967/in-mexico-trump-reaffirms-u-s-right-to-protect-its-borders,https://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/donald-trump-immigration-address-transcript-227614,https://pictures.reuters.com/CS.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&VBID=2C0FCIUVQX3JB&SMLS=1&RW=1305&RH=673&PN=3&POPUPPN=151&POPUPIID=2C0BF1F59DJE2,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/15/fact-check-meme-el-chapo-guzman-testify-nancy-pelosi-adam-schiff-hillary-clinton-millions/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#94e0e6f1e2fbe6d4f0f5fdf8edf7f5f8f8f1e6baf7fbf9","No, The Wall Street Journal Didn’t Run Opposing Headlines For The Same Story To Influence Readers",,,,,

There are more than 17 million vacant homes across the U.S., according to the Census Bureau. Fact Check:  “No Masters No Gods,” an online clothing store that sells clothing and other merchandise with left-leaning messages, posted the image on Dec. 13.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Over 633k homeless in US, over 13.9 million vacant homes, 22 homes available per person, capitalism must end,” reads the caption. It cites the National Alliance to End Homelessness (NAEH) as the source of its figures. While it’s accurate to say there are more vacant homes than homeless people in the U.S., the statistics cited in the image aren’t correct. (RELATED: Is Homelessness Up Nearly 50 Percent In Los Angeles Since 2013?) Tom Murphy, director of communications for NAEH, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that the figure for homelessness doesn’t reflect the most recent data, saying, “The last time the numbers were in that range was 2010, when the count was 637,077. The most recent federal data is for 2018, when the count was at 552,830.”  Brad Sylvester/Daily Caller News Foundation  In 2018, approximately 65 percent of all homeless people, or 358,363 individuals, were sheltered in some capacity, while the remaining 194,467 homeless people were unsheltered, according to NAEH. (The number of homeless people has fluctuated in recent years but has generally trended downward over the past decade.)  The Census Bureau tracks the number of vacant homes in the U.S. on a quarterly basis and, as of October 2019, the number stands at about 17 million. That’s roughly 3.1 million more than the meme suggests. The last time the number of vacant homes was 13.9 million was in 2001, according to the Federal Reserve of St. Louis.  Brad Sylvester/Daily Caller News Foundation  Based on currently available numbers, there are about 31 vacant housing units for every homeless person in the U.S. (RELATED: Did Ben Carson Call Homelessness ‘A Gift From Heaven’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Some government programs have been instituted to utilize vacant properties to help house homeless people. For instance, the Title V program of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act “enables eligible organizations to use unutilized, underutilized, excess, or surplus federal properties to assist persons experiencing homelessness,” according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s website. Many of the vacant housing units on the market are homes that have been foreclosed and are now owned by banks, according to Business Insider.

Scientific research supports their assertions. Fact Check: More than 400 species of sharks live in the world’s oceans, according to the Shark Research Institute. They all belong to the chondrichthyan classification, which includes other cartilaginous fish like skates, rays and chimaeras.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Sharks are the only animals that never get sick,” one Facebook post claims. “They are even immune to every known disease including cancer.” However, peer-reviewed scientific studies conducted over the years have documented forms of cancer and various other diseases in shark species. For instance, a 2016 study in the Journal of Fish Diseases found that one third of at least 44 cases of lesions in 21 species, including sharks, rays and skates, were malignant. Sharks can get infections – bacterial and viral – and parasites too. The Daily Caller also reached out to experts, all of whom refuted the Facebook post’s claim. (RELATED: Fact-Checking Trump’s Comment On Wind Farms And Cancer) “This claim is false and has proven false multiple times,” said Melissa Marquez, the marine biologist who founded the Fins United Initiative, an education and conservation program. “Sharks can get an array of diseases, including cancer.”  “Sharks do get cancer but perhaps at a lower rate than other groups,” University of Guelph integrative biology professor Jim Ballantyne told the Caller in an email. Scientists have been aware of the fact that sharks are susceptible to cancer for more than 150 years, according to Scientific American.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  According to Business Insider, the myth that sharks have immunity to cancer dates back to at least the 1970s, when researchers at John Hopkins University observed that shark cartilage could stop blood vessels from growing into tissues, as occurs in cancerous tumors. Another scientist in Florida exposed sharks to carcinogens and found that they didn’t develop tumors, according to Scientific American. That research formed the basis of the shark cartilage pill industry, which marketed shark cartilage as a miracle cure for cancer, despite numerous studies proving that it has no effectiveness in treating cancer, according to Scientific American. The shark cartilage pill industry has also negatively impacted shark populations, according to the American Museum of Natural History.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/FactsThatWillBlowYourMind/photos/a.690279667675357/2673956382640999/?type=3&theater,https://www.sharks.org/species,https://www.britannica.com/animal/chondrichthian,https://www.britannica.com/animal/skate-fish,https://www.britannica.com/animal/ray-fish,https://www.britannica.com/animal/chimaera,https://www.facebook.com/FactsThatWillBlowYourMind/photos/a.690279667675357/2673956382640999/?type=3&theater,https://www.pnas.org/content/116/10/4446,https://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/64/23/8485.long,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301300604_First_histological_examination_of_a_neoplastic_lesion_from_a_free-swimming_white_shark_Carcharodon_carcharias_L,https://www.britannica.com/animal/chondrichthian,https://www.calacademy.org/explore-science/shark-parasites,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/04/09/fact-check-trump-wind-turbine-cancer/,https://melissacristinamarquez.weebly.com/,https://www.finsunited.co.nz/tfui-origins.html,https://www.uoguelph.ca/ib/ballantyne,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sharks-do-get-cancer-tumor-found-great-white/,https://www.insider.com/shark-myths-untrue-2018-7#myth-sharks-can-cure-cancer-7,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/mythbusting-101-sharks-will-cure-cancer/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9831372,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9817287,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9817287,https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/science-sushi/mythbusting-101-sharks-will-cure-cancer/#6,https://www.amnh.org/learn/pd/sharks_rays/rfl_myth/myth_page6.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3878196859c81b397929a9f8a90929f9f9681dd909c9e",Are Sharks Immune To Cancer And All Other Diseases?,,,,,

Fact Check:  The Facebook post alleges in an image that MacKenzie Bezos became the richest woman in the world after getting $40 billion in her divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. It has been shared more than 4,400 times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The couple announced their decision to divorce after 25 years of marriage in a joint Twitter statement in January.

As part of the divorce settlement, Jeff Bezos transferred a quarter of his Amazon stock or 19.7 million shares to MacKenzie Bezos, according to Forbes. That 4-percent stake in Amazon and her other assets make her the fourth richest woman in the world with an estimated net worth of $35.3 billion. (RELATED: Is J.K.

As of the end of the Dec. 23 trading day, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index offers slightly different rankings for the richest women in the world, putting MacKenzie Bezos ($36 billion) at number five behind Koch ($62.1 billion), Bettencourt Meyers ($58.6 billion), Walton ($53.1 billion) and Jacqueline Mars ($42.7 billion), the granddaughter of candy company Mars’ founder.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   Brad Sylvester/Daily Caller News Foundation  Jeff Bezos currently ranks as the second wealthiest person in the world at an estimated $112 billion, behind only Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who has an estimated net worth of $113 billion, according to Bloomberg.

Susan Schwab, currently serves on the nine-person board, according to a State Department spokesperson. Schwab does not appear in the photo Pompeo tweeted because she could not attend the board’s most recent meeting. Fact Check: Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, established the Department of State’s Foreign Affairs Policy Board in 2011. Its members provide the secretary of state and senior department officials with independent advice on foreign policy issues. The board most recently held a meeting Dec. 16, according to the Federal Register.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shared a photograph of him posing with eight members of the board on Twitter the same day.  A pleasure hosting Foreign Affairs Policy Board members for dinner last night in advance of our third plenary meeting this year. Their feedback and perspectives are critical to the formulation and execution of a foreign policy that best serves the American people’s interests. pic.twitter.com/jQKAbvKkXs — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) December 16, 2019  “A pleasure hosting Foreign Affairs Policy Board members for dinner last night in advance of our third plenary meeting this year,” Pompeo tweeted. “Their feedback and perspectives are critical to the formulation and execution of a foreign policy that best serves the American people’s interests.” Shortly after Pompeo posted the photograph on Twitter, The New Civil Rights Movement and AlterNet published similar articles on their respective websites, detailing online reactions to the picture.  “U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is under fire after posting a photo of members of his Foreign Affairs Policy Board that is comprised of nearly all white men and no women,” wrote The New Civil Rights Movement founder and editor David Badash. “In 2011 then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton created the advisory board. It has, before Pompeo, been a far more diverse group.” Boards under previous secretaries of state have indeed comprised of more women. For instance, Clinton’s board included New America think tank CEO Anne-Marie Slaughter, former Democratic California Rep. Jane Harman, former Ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian States Nina Hachigian and former U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills, among others.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  However, it’s inaccurate to say that the Foreign Affairs Policy Board presently has no female members. The board has one female member – Schwab, a former U.S. trade representative – out of its nine total members, according to State Department Bureau of Global Public Affairs Senior Advisor James Hewitt. Schwab, who told the Daily Caller she joined the board this past summer, does not appear in the picture Pompeo tweeted out Dec. 16 because she was unable to attend the most recent meeting. “I missed the most recent (3rd) meeting of the group because the Boeing board was meeting in Chicago at the same time,” said Schwab, who has served on the board of directors for aerospace company Boeing since 2010, according to SEC filings. According to the board’s current fiscal year report, here are the other eight members: Apple Vice President of Americas and Northeast Asia Douglas Beck, Jigsaw CEO Jared Cohen, Goldman Sachs Managing Director James Donovan, retired U.S. Navy Admiral Cecil Haney, WilmerHale Senior International Counsel Robert Kimmitt, former MTV CEO William Roedy, Valor Capital Group Senior Partner Clifford Sobel and former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Charles Welch. “It is worth noting that this is a very new advisory board,” Schwab told the Caller in an email. “Our first meeting was in the summer, and this was only the third. I know that they are recruiting other women.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.alternet.org/2019/12/mike-pompeo-pilloried-over-photo-showing-policy-board-created-by-hillary-clinton-is-now-full-of-lots-of-white-men-but-no-women/,https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/sschwab-bio.html,https://www.state.gov/key-topics-policy-planning-staff/,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/21/2019-25187/foreign-affairs-policy-board-meeting-notice-of-closed-meeting,https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1206528488951472129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1206528488951472129&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com%2F2019%2F12%2Fpompeo-pilloried-after-posting-photo-of-policy-board-hillary-clinton-created-that-now-has-lots-of-white-males-but-no-women%2F,https://t.co/jQKAbvKkXs,https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1206528488951472129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw,https://twitter.com/SecPompeo/status/1206528488951472129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1206528488951472129&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com%2F2019%2F12%2Fpompeo-pilloried-after-posting-photo-of-policy-board-hillary-clinton-created-that-now-has-lots-of-white-males-but-no-women%2F,https://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/2019/12/pompeo-pilloried-after-posting-photo-of-policy-board-hillary-clinton-created-that-now-has-lots-of-white-males-but-no-women/,https://www.alternet.org/2019/12/mike-pompeo-pilloried-over-photo-showing-policy-board-created-by-hillary-clinton-is-now-full-of-lots-of-white-men-but-no-women/,https://www.alternet.org/2019/12/mike-pompeo-pilloried-over-photo-showing-policy-board-created-by-hillary-clinton-is-now-full-of-lots-of-white-men-but-no-women/,https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/12/178274.htm,https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/p/fapb/c50662.htm,https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/anne-marie-slaughter/,https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/14550,https://foreignpolicy.com/author/nina-hachigian/,http://www.hillsandco.com/professionals/carla-a-hills/,https://www.facadatabase.gov/FACA/apex/FACACommitteeLevelReportAsPDF?id=a10t0000001gzp7AAA,https://www.boeing.com/company/general-info/corporate-governance.page,https://www.boeing.com/company/,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/12927/000119312510056985/ddef14a.htm,https://www.facadatabase.gov/FACA/apex/FACACommitteeLevelReportAsPDF?id=a10t0000001gzp7AAA,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d797f687b627f4d696c6461746e6c6161687f236e6260",Does The State Department’s Foreign Affairs Policy Board Currently Have No Female Members?,,,,,

Fact Check: Melissa Jefferson, known professionally as Lizzo, has released three studio albums so far. Her most recent album, entitled “Cuz I Love You,” peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. Lizzo has been nominated for eight Grammy awards.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The alleged tweet, which was screen grabbed and posted on Facebook, masquerades as a breaking news alert from TMZ, saying, “BREAKING: 4 dead, 12 injured after artist Lizzo performed a stage dive at a show in New York.” It appears to be an attempt at body-shaming the Grammy-nominated artist. Yet, while it mimics the breaking news format used by some outlets on Twitter, TMZ has never tweeted this news alert. It doesn’t appear anywhere on the entertainment news outlet’s verified Twitter account. Nor can any story be found on TMZ’s website. (RELATED: Did Morgan Freeman Propose A Holiday To Reduce Light Pollution On Twitter?) The post’s claim that Lizzo did a stage dive at New York show doesn’t hold up either. If Lizzo had performed one, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported it, and social media users haven’t documented any instances. Lizzo made her “Saturday Night Live” debut on Dec. 21, performing her hit songs “Truth Hurts” and “Good as Hell,” according to Rolling Stone.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/ihatemumblecrap/photos/a.1926174194260898/2490022864542692/?type=3&theater,https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/04/24/how-lizzo-went-underground-phenom-rising-pop-star/,https://www.amazon.com/Cuz-Love-You-Super-Deluxe/dp/B07YTDCXDC/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Lizzo+Cuz+I+Love+You&qid=1576607004&s=music&sr=1-1,https://www.billboard.com/music/lizzo/chart-history/billboard-200,https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-nominees-list,https://www.facebook.com/ihatemumblecrap/photos/a.1926174194260898/2490022864542692/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/search?q=Lizzo%20stage%20(from%3ATMZ)&src=typed_query,https://www.tmz.com/search/?q=Lizzo,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/11/06/fact-check-morgan-freeman-tweet-space-day-light-pollution/,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lizzo-snl-truth-hurts-good-as-hell-aidy-bryant-930397/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#93e7e1f6e5fce1d3f7f2faffeaf0f2fffff6e1bdf0fcfe","No, TMZ Didn’t Tweet About A Lizzo Concert That Turned Deadly After A Stage Dive",,,,,

Fact Check: Launched in 1997, the Cassini spacecraft orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017. Its European Space Agency probe, Huygens, landed on the surface of Saturn’s moon Titan in 2005 and began transmitting scientific data back to Earth. The Cassini spacecraft itself took more than 453,000 images of Saturn and other celestial bodies during its roughly 20-year mission.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post falsely alleges that an image appearing to show Saturn and its rings was taken by the Cassini spacecraft, with the caption saying, “NASA’s Cassini probe was a nuclear-powered spacecraft that orbited Saturn for 13 years. It sent back hundreds of thousands of images. This is just one of them.” However, the Cassini spacecraft did not produce the image in the Facebook post. The picture, found through a reverse image search, is actually an artist’s depiction of Cassini making one of its last orbital trips. NASA published the illustration in April 2017, several months before the Cassini burned up in Saturn’s atmosphere. “This artist’s concept shows an over-the-shoulder view of Cassini making one of its Grand Finale dives over Saturn,” reads NASA’s caption for the image. (RELATED: Did NASA Spend More Than $165 Million To Develop Pens That Work In Space?) The first spacecraft to fly by Saturn was NASA’s Pioneer 11 probe. It flew by the ringed planet in 1979 and is on a trajectory that will take it outside the solar system, according to NASA.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/YasdnilAnairb/posts/10157858390642938,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/overview/,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/mission/spacecraft/huygens-probe/,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/galleries/images/?page=0&per_page=25&order=created_at+desc&search=&tags=cassini&condition_1=1%3Ais_in_resource_list&category=51,https://www.facebook.com/YasdnilAnairb/posts/10157858390642938,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/17639/cassini-grand-finale-concept/,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/17639/cassini-grand-finale-concept/,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/11/25/fact-check-nasa-165-million-develop-space-pens-fisher/,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/pioneer-11/in-depth/,https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/pioneer-11/in-depth/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ed999f889b829fad898c8481948e8c8181889fc38e8280",Did NASA’s Cassini Spacecraft Take This Picture Of Saturn?,,,,,

Bernie Sanders that reads: “My object in life is to dethrone God and destroy capitalism.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Sanders making the statement on Twitter or elsewhere. Fact Check: Sanders, a Democratic Vermont senator, officially kicked off his 2020 presidential election campaign in February. He previously made a bid for the Democratic nomination during the 2016 election cycle.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    An image falsely alleged in a post that Sanders tweeted about his aspiration to “dethrone God and destroy capitalism.” The supposed tweet dates back to Aug. 10, 2015. (RELATED: 5 Claims From Bernie Sanders’ Presidential Campaign Announcement Video) However, the Daily Caller didn’t find any matching and similar tweets on either of his verified Twitter accounts. A search of ProPublica’s archive of deleted tweets yielded no results. There aren’t any credible sources linking the statement to him online either. Sanders, who was raised Jewish, has spoken about his religious beliefs on a number of occasions during his political career. For instance, he told The Washington Post in a 2016 interview that he believes in God but is “not actively involved with organized religion.” “Faith is a guiding principle in Bernie’s life. Everyone practices religion in a different way,” the Sanders campaign told the Interfaith Alliance of Iowa in a recent interview. “For Bernie, he would not be running for president of the United States if he did not have a strong religious and spiritual foundation.”  Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, has criticized “unfettered capitalism” in the past but also stated that he doesn’t “believe the government should own the means of production,” according to Time. In a June speech at George Washington University, Sanders proposed a “21st century economic bill of rights,” including health care, affordable housing, education and a living wage.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=973764742988806&set=a.108075742891048&type=3&theater,https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/02/19/bernie-sanders-announces-2020-presidential-run-newday-vpx.cnn,https://www.vox.com/2016/5/17/11686336/bernie-sanders-lost-democratic-nomination,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=973764742988806&set=a.108075742891048&type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/02/24/fact-check-bernie-sanders-campaign-announcement/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%22dethrone%20God%22%22%20(from%3ASenSanders%20OR%20from%3ABernieSanders)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/SenSanders,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bernie-sanders-finally-answers-the-god-question/2016/01/26/83429390-bfb0-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html?postshare=9611453895803704,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sanders-campaign-cites-strong-religious-and-spiritual-foundation-as-key-to-his-run,http://interfaithallianceiowa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019FDQ-Sanders.pdf,https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2015/10/13/sanders-democratic-debate-bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-5.cnn,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/12/18663217/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism-speech-transcript,https://time.com/4121126/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism/,https://time.com/4121126/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism/,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/12/18661708/bernie-sanders-definition-democratic-socialism-explained,https://www.vox.com/2019/6/12/18663217/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialism-speech-transcript,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f0848295869f82b09491999c8993919c9c9582de939f9d","Did Bernie Sanders Tweet, ‘My Object In Life Is To Dethrone God And Destroy Capitalism’?",,,,,

Trey Gowdy said, “Nobody has the right to serve in the military.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence Gowdy ever made this statement. It likely got linked to him after a Gowdy fan page posted it on social media. Fact Check:  President Donald Trump announced on Twitter July 26, 2017, that the country would no longer “accept or allow” transgender individuals to serve in the military. The modified policy, which took effect in April of this year, bars people seeking treatment for gender dysphoria from enlisting and requires military personnel to serve as their biological gender, with a few exceptions. It is being challenged in court, according to NBC News.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 92,000 times, alleges that Gowdy gave a statement defending the transgender military ban in an interview with a CNN reporter. It is accompanied by a photo of Gowdy. (RELATED: Will Sonic The Hedgehog Be Transgender In An Upcoming Movie?) “The Military has one job: Winning War. Anything else is a distraction and a liability,” reads part of Gowdy’s alleged statement. “Did someone just scream? That isn’t Fair? War is VERY unfair, there are no exceptions made for being special or challenged or socially wonderful. YOU must change yourself to meet Military standards and not the other way around.” There is, however, no evidence Gowdy ever said or wrote the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of CNN’s website and Grabien, a video clip editing service, didn’t turn up any instances of Gowdy making this statement about the transgender military ban. No credible online sources link him to it either. “Never wrote a word of it,” said Gowdy in a phone interview with the Daily Caller. “Not one single solitary word came from me. I never addressed the topic.”  The statement, debunked by TruthOrFiction.com in 2017, likely got attributed to Gowdy after the Trey Gowdy News and Support Facebook page shared it in July 2017, even though the account disclaims that it has no affiliation with Gowdy. Prior to the statement being linked to Gowdy, variations appeared in online discussion forums without attribution.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Directed-energy weapons use focused light, sound or particle beams to damage targeted objects. A number of nations, including the U.S., Russia and India, are currently developing such weapons for military purposes.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral image, posted Oct. 28, falsely alleged that three different photographs show directed-energy weapons starting wildfires, with the caption saying, “This is what is believed to be responsible for those #California wild fires (sic) it’s called ‘DEW’ direct energy weapons.” (RELATED: Did Climate Change Cause The California Wildfires?) The image on the left actually shows a SpaceX rocket launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California last year. The original photograph, found through a reverse image search, appears on the aerospace company’s official Instagram page. The upper-right photo, debunked by Snopes in 2018, likely depicts light from a controlled gas flare at an Ohio oil refinery reflecting off ice particles in the atmosphere. This optical phenomenon, also called a light pillar, can occur in cold weather conditions. Tweeted out by the Forest Service of Klamath National Forest, the lower-right picture does show a California wildfire – and a white line appearing to extend from the sky to the ground. The Forest Service, whose firefighters took the photo, clarified in another tweet that the line was a camera lens flare.

The photo actually shows him praying before a 2011 Denver Broncos football game. Fact Check: Tebow, a former NFL player and current minor league baseball player, has publicly demonstrated his Christian beliefs on numerous occasions, from genuflecting on the football field to painting bible verses into his eye black. In 2010, he appeared alongside his mother in a Super Bowl advertisement for Focus on the Family, an anti-abortion Christian organization.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which features Tebow in his signature kneeling pose, uses the image to suggest that his alleged 2012 protest against abortion was received differently than former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s protests against racism. In late August 2016, Kaepernick refused to stand for the pre-game playing of the national anthem in protest of racism. “He was praised by fans for being a ‘model American,’ then was given 3 new NFL contracts in addition to a Major League Baseball contract,” reads the caption. “Unlike Colin Kaepernick, who CLEARLY stated that his protest has nothing to do with the flag or military, Time (sic) Tebow specifically said he couldn’t stand for a flag that allowed for abortion. If you can’t see the hypocrisy in this then chances are you are part of the problem.” The accompanying image does not, however, show Tebow kneeling during the national anthem. Taken by Associated Press photographer Julie Jacobson, the photo actually depicts him praying before a Denver Broncos football game against the Chicago Bears in December 2011, per its caption. Tebow is widely known for kneeling in prayer before, during and after football games. The Daily Caller didn’t find any credible media reports of Tebow ever kneeling during the national anthem to protest abortion or any other social issue, further adding to the post’s dubiousness. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Former NFL Players Joe Namath And Al Woodall Kneeling During The National Anthem)  In June 2018, Tebow responded to a similar viral social media post in an interview with USA Today, saying, “I think that’s sometimes one of the things that’s a little bit sad is sometimes people will just try to create something that had zero truth. I never did anything during a national anthem but stand and support my country.” His statement came after rapper T.I. reposted an image with the same claim on Instagram, according to the Washington Times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=168556490873154&set=gm.2568299873404692&type=3&theater,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tim-tebow-mets-2020-general-manager,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/sports/football/tebow-professes-his-evangelical-faith-carefully.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw7qX1TpdNQ,https://www.focusonthefamily.com/about/foundational-values/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=168556490873154&set=gm.2568299873404692&type=3&theater,http://www.espn.com/espn/page2/index/_/id/7161600,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=168556490873154&set=gm.2568299873404692&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=168556490873154&set=gm.2568299873404692&type=3&theater,http://www.apimages.com/metadata/Index/Broncos-Manning-Football/a39aa67bae7f4c128e634ade8501b2fc/23/0,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/11/25/fact-check-image-nfl-namath-woodall-kneeling-national-anthem-football/,https://www.instagram.com/p/BjS923QhbtI/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2018/06/08/tim-tebow-kneeling-national-anthem/686533002/,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1939267/,https://www.instagram.com/p/BjS923QhbtI/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/12/tim-tebow-denies-he-kneeled-to-protest-during-the-/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b4c0c6d1c2dbc6f4d0d5ddd8cdd7d5d8d8d1c69ad7dbd9",Did Tim Tebow Kneel During The National Anthem To Protest Against Abortion?,,,,,

David Edelman. He has not worked for the government since early 2017. Fact Check: The House voted to impeach President Donald Trump on counts of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress Dec. 18. It comes months after a member of the intelligence community filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A viral Facebook post falsely alleged that a bespectacled man circled in the photo, taken by Getty photographer Nicholas Kamm on Nov. 9, 2016, is the Ukraine whistleblower.

(RELATED: Do These Viral Photos Show The Stanford Law Professor Who Testified At The Impeachment Hearings?) “Here is the whistleblower standing with the Obama administration the day after Trump won the election,” reads the Facebook caption. However, the man pictured is actually Edelman, a former White House staffer who has worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since March 2017. He previously worked as the special assistant to the president for economic and technology policy in the Obama administration. Edelman debunked a similar claim on Twitter Nov. 7.

Barack Obama, the president at the time, announced bin Laden’s death on national television that evening.

It has been shared more than 5,600 times. (RELATED: Do These Images Show The Ukraine Whistleblower Posing With Democrats?) The upper-right photo, which shows Clinton shaking hands with bin Laden in front of a crowd, appears to have been created in 2007 for a Photoshop contest held by the website FreakingNews.com. The original picture shows Clinton shaking hands with Indian musician Shubhashish Mukherjee in 2004. Bin Laden’s head has also been photoshopped onto that of another individual in the bottom-right photo. The image, found through a reverse image search, actually depicts Obama and attorney Andre Wooten giving a thumbs-up gesture in 2008. It appears on the cover of Daphne Barbee-Wooten’s book “African-American Attorneys in Hawaii.”  “I took the photo of my husband Andre Wooten with then Senator Barack Obama in Honolulu, HI on my iPhone during a Democratic event,” Barbee-Wooten told the Daily Caller in an email.

Verdict: False There’s no record of The New York Times ever publishing this article. A spokeswoman for the publication told the Daily Caller the image has been doctored. FiveThirtyEight‘s average of Nevada primary polls has Sanders in second place with 20.7 percent support. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 1,900 times, attempts to paint The New York Times in a negative light, suggesting that the publication put out an article with a misleading headline about Democratic Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders‘ performance in Nevada primary polls. “Sanders Loses Third Place Spot in Nevada to Buttigieg,” reads the alleged headline. (RELATED: Do Only 25% Of Americans Support Impeachment, As Trump Claims?) A subheadline below that says, “As the senator rises to first in the polls, Buttigieg claims a strong lead behind Elizabeth Warren.” There is, however, no evidence that The New York Times ever published the article shown in the Facebook post. A search of The New York Times archive turned up no matching or similar headlines.  “It is a doctored screenshot,” said Danielle Rhoades Ha, the vice president of communications at The New York Times, in an email to the Caller. “The New York Times did not write or publish the story.” FiveThirtyEight shows former Vice President Joe Biden leading with 26.9 percent support in an average of Nevada Democratic primary polls, followed by Sanders at 20.7 percent and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 14.7 percent. The same average of polls puts South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in fourth place with 8.2 percent support.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The Nevada Democratic presidential caucuses will take place on Feb. 22, 2020, according to the Nevada Secretary of State website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  The Facebook post features pictures of Greta Thunberg, a teenage environmental activist, and George Soros, a billionaire Democratic donor. Both have been the subject of misinformation on Facebook in recent months. (RELATED: Does This Picture Show Greta Thunberg With George Soros?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Why are we not going to China?” reads a speech bubble near Thunberg. Another speech bubble near Soros says, “Shut up and stick to the script!” The post also makes a dubious claim about China’s contribution to the world’s total carbon emissions, with the caption reading, “China produces 90 percent of the world’s carbon emissions pollution! They didn’t go to China because it’s already a communist country!” While China does lead the world in both carbon and total greenhouse gas emissions, it does not account for 90% of global carbon emissions. The country emitted approximately 9.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2018, according to the 2019 BP Statistical Review of World Energy report. That equates to about 27.8% of global carbon emissions.  The same report found that the U.S., the number two emitter, produced roughly 5.1 billion tons of carbon emissions in 2018, or approximately 15.2% of the global 33.9 billion tons. (The International Energy Agency and Global Carbon Project report similar figures.)  Graphic: the DCNF  China surpassed the U.S. as the top emitter in 2005, per the 2019 BP Statistical Review of World Energy report. It now emits more carbon than both the U.S. and the European Union (EU) combined, according to The New York Times.

Indeed, China’s emissions have rapidly increased over the past two decades as a result of its growing and modernizing economy. In large part, the country meets its increased energy demand by burning coal, according to The New York Times. The Global Carbon Project found that a majority of Chinese carbon emissions come from this method of energy production. As a signatory of the Paris Agreement, China has pledged that its emissions will peak no later than 2030.

She told the Daily Caller the women pictured in the left and lower-right photos are not her. Fact Check: Karlan, a professor of public interest law and the co-director of the Supreme Court Litigation Clinic at Stanford Law School, testified at the House Judiciary Committee impeachment hearing Dec. 4. She and three other law school professors appeared before the committee to discuss the constitutional grounds for impeaching President Donald Trump, according to Roll Call.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post features two different photographs of women wearing pro-feminist clothing: one wearing a pink crocheted “pussy hat” and one wearing a “vagina lady” costume. It claims those photos, as well as a third depicting a woman taking a legal oath, show Karlan. “This was the democrats constitutional ‘expert’ impeachment witness, Stanford law professor Pamela Karlen (sic),” reads the caption. While the upper-right image does show Karlan being sworn in before her Dec. 4 testimony, there’s no evidence that the women in the pictures on the lower-right and left are the Stanford law professor. (Do These Images Show The Ukraine Whistleblower Posing With Democrats?) A reverse image search revealed that the photo on the left depicts a protestor at the January 2017 Women’s March in Washington, D.C. The photo, taken by Agence France-Presse photographer Robyn Beck, appeared in numerous media reports about the event; however, none identified the woman wearing the pink crocheted hat as Karlan.  The lower-right photo, also found through a reverse image search, doesn’t identify Karlan as the woman wearing a costume and carrying a “vagina lady” sign either. It comes from a Flickr album of pictures from the 2007 Bay to Breakers footrace held in San Francisco every year. “I attended neither event,” Karlan told the Caller in an email. “I appear in neither picture.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The House Judiciary Committee voted Dec. 13 to send two articles of impeachment before the entire House, according to ABC News.

I called it the day before,” said Trump. “I was opening up Turnberry, the day before Brexit.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The ceremony for the reopening of Trump’s Turnberry golf course occurred the day after the June 23, 2016, European Union (EU) referendum. Trump did accurately foretell the outcome of the vote, but his prediction came months earlier in a March 2016 ITV interview. Fact Check:  Trump met with other NATO leaders in London early December to mark the 70th anniversary of the alliance. During a Dec. 3 press conference, Trump once again said he predicted that the U.K. would vote to leave the EU the day before the referendum occurred. His prediction happened at the opening of his Turnberry golf course, he said.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “You know that I was a fan of Brexit. I called it the day before,” said Trump. “I was opening up Turnberry the day before Brexit. You were there; many of you were there. I mean, I recognize that many of you were there. And they asked me whether or not Brexit would happen. I said ‘yes,’ and everybody smiled and they laughed.” The Brexit referendum occurred June 23, 2016, with a slim margin of U.K. citizens voting to leave the EU, according to BBC News. Trump did not arrive in Scotland for the reopening of the Trump Turnberry Resort until June 24, 2016, the day after the vote, according to numerous media reports. Trump, who was the presumptive Republican presidential nominee at the time, tweeted his arrival in Scotland that morning — and even included a comment about the outcome of the vote.

They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!” reads the tweet.  On June 22, 2016, the day before the referendum, Trump did discuss Brexit in a Fox Business interview, but he didn’t make a prediction about the vote’s outcome at any point, according to the video. “I don’t think anybody should listen to me because I haven’t really focused on it very much,” Trump told anchor Maria Bartiromo. “But my inclination would be to get out because, you know, just go it alone.” (RELATED: Is Europe The US’s Largest Trading Partner?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Yet, while there’s no record of him foretelling the outcome the day before the referendum, he did accurately predict that the U.K. would vote to leave the EU in a March 2016 interview with “Good Morning Britain” anchor Piers Morgan. He gave the interview from a studio in Florida, according to CNN. “I think that Britain will separate from the EU,” Trump said during that interview. “I think that maybe it’s time, especially in light of what’s happening with the craziness that’s going on, with the migration, with people pouring in all over the place. I think that Britain will end up separating from the EU, that’s my opinion.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

No such amendment exists. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Constitution provides a framework for the federal government and guarantees certain basic rights to U.S. citizens. To date, it has 27 amendments. Yet, while the Constitution’s 27 amendments are clearly enumerated, a viral Facebook post alleges in an image that there is a “28th Amendment” barring Congress from making laws that do not apply equally to both citizens and legislators. The text of this “28th Amendment” has been circulating on various platforms since at least 2010, according to FactCheck.org. “Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to the Senators and Representatives,” reads the bogus amendment. “And, Congress shall make no law that applies to the Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to the Citizens of the United States.” The most recent amendment to the Constitution stipulates that any change in pay for members of the House and Senate cannot take effect “until an election of representatives shall have intervened.” It was ratified in 1992, according to the National Constitution Center.  Some lawmakers have proposed amendments similar to the one in the Facebook post, but they have never been ratified.

Fact Check:  The internet is replete with inspirational quotes attributed to Churchill.

(RELATED: Did Winston Churchill Say This Quote About Getting Older?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The DCNF didn’t find any record of it in the Churchill Archives, an online database containing around 800,000 original documents related to the statesman. In fact, a quick internet search revealed that the International Churchill Society has identified it and a thematically related statement as falsely attributed to Churchill. “We can find no attribution for either one of these and you will find that they are broadly attributed to Winston Churchill,” reads the International Churchill Society website. “They are found nowhere in his canon, however. An almost equal number of sources found online credit these sayings to Abraham Lincoln – but we have found none that provides any attribution in the Lincoln Archives.” Richard Langworth, a senior fellow at the Hillsdale College Churchill Project, also addressed the “phony ‘success’ quotes” on his website. “These pop up by the dozens every day,” Langworth wrote. “While included in some poorly researched quote books, neither can be found among Churchill’s 50 million published books, articles, speeches and papers; and words about him by close colleagues.”  The website Quote Investigator found the earliest close match in a 1938 Budweiser print advertisement that ran in numerous newspapers. However, elements of the expression have appeared since at least 1905, according to Quote Investigator. “Men with the spirit of youth pioneered our America … men with vision and sturdy confidence,” reads the ad. “They found contentment in the thrill of action, knowing that success was never final and failure never fatal.

The picture, housed at the National Portrait Gallery in London, was taken by French photographer Camille Silvy in 1862, according to the website. Bonetta, the daughter of an Egbado chieftain of the Yoruba people, was enslaved during intertribal warfare and later brought to England by a British sea captain, according to the National Portrait Gallery. In 1850, Queen Victoria took up sponsorship of Bonetta’s education and welfare. This isn’t the first time social media users have erroneously claimed viral images show Tubman.

Fact Check:  Gandhi, a lawyer and politician, was a central figure in India’s independence movement from British rule. His teachings, writings and speeches have influenced other social activists, including American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and former South African President Nelson Mandela.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, there is no evidence that Gandhi ever actually said or wrote the expression attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched for it in the Gandhi Heritage Portal‘s 100 volumes of original documents related to the social activist but found no matches. “I strongly suspect that this quotation … is not a direct quote from Gandhi’s own speeches or writings,” said Johannes Bakker, a retired University of Guelph professor and Gandhi expert, in an email to the DCNF. Bakker noted that the “sentiment is Gandhian,” pointing to a thematically related expression written by Gandhi in a 1913 work. (RELATED: Did Gandhi Say, ‘First They Ignore You, Then They Laugh At You, Then They Fight You, Then You Win’?) “If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change,” wrote Gandhi. “As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him.”  The website Quote Investigator found the earliest close match to the saying in educator Arleen Lorrance’s chapter of the 1974 book “Developing Priorities and a Style: Selected Readings in Education for Teachers and Parents.” In the chapter, she wrote, “One way to start a preventative program is to be the change you want to see happen.” The quote has been attributed to Gandhi since at least 1987, according to Quote Investigator.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The quote attributed to Jefferson in the Facebook post appears to fall into the latter group.

Verdict: False The image actually shows a large crowd at the bridge’s 50th anniversary celebration in 1987. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Golden Gate Bridge, a 1.7-mile long suspension bridge connecting San Francisco to neighboring Marin County, was constructed over a period of roughly four years in the 1930s. It opened to foot traffic on May 27, 1937, sometimes referred to as Pedestrian Day, and to vehicular traffic the following day, according to the Golden Gate Bridge website. A reverse image search revealed that this image does not depict the public opening of the Golden Gate Bridge on Pedestrian Day. Taken by photographer Deanne Fitzmaurice for the San Francisco Chronicle, the picture actually shows a large crowd at the celebration of the bridge’s 50th anniversary in 1987, according to its caption. (RELATED: Does This Image Show Members Of Congress Playing Solitaire While In Session?) “The bridge was closed to automobile traffic for the celebration on May 1987, and nearly one million people showed up for the bridge crossing,” reads the caption. “Poor crowd control led to 300,000 people on the span at once and the bridge actually flattened out in the middle under their weight.” During the 50th anniversary celebrations, the bridge did indeed temporarily flattened in the middle, according to The New York Times. However, it did not cause permanent damage nor were there any serious concerns from engineers that the bridge would collapse under the crowd’s weight, according to Mercury News.  “It was probably the biggest load the bridge had ever seen,” Mark Ketchum, a San Francisco bridge engineer, told Mercury News in 2012. “But it did not exceed the design load capacity of the bridge.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Kennedy gave away their presidential salaries. Washington claimed to not want or need a salary, but eventually accepted one. Fact Check:  Trump, a real estate mogul with an estimated net worth of $3.1 billion, is once again donating his quarterly presidential salary to a government agency, according to ABC News. (RELATED: Have Congressional Salaries Gone Up 231% In The Past 30 Years?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    His $100,000 third-quarter paycheck will go to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health with an earmark to “continue the ongoing fight against the opioid crisis,” the White House stated Nov. 26, according to The Associated Press. Under U.S. federal code, the president receives a $400,000 annual salary plus a $50,000 expense account. Trump promised early in his 2016 campaign that he would refuse the fixed presidential salary afforded to him in the Constitution. He appears to have stuck by that promise so far, donating each of his quarterly paychecks to various government agencies, including the Department of Education, Small Business Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. In a press scrum before an Oct. 21 cabinet meeting, Trump said he’s the only commander-in-chief other than Washington to forgo his presidential salary. It came after a reporter asked Trump about his bid to host the upcoming G-7 summit at his Doral, Florida, golf resort. “They say that no other president has done it. I’m surprised, to be honest with you,” said Trump. “They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president that did, but they say no other. So I give up — it’s a lot of money, $450,000, close to.”  Yet, while Trump appears to have donated all of his presidential paychecks to date, he’s not the only president in history to do so. Hoover and Kennedy, the 31st and 35th presidents respectively, also gave away their salaries. Like Trump, Hoover was independently wealthy prior to taking the oath of office in 1929. He donated his presidential salary to several different charities and to his associates, according to biographer George Nash.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “Hoover practiced the philanthropic values that he professed,” wrote Nash. “As president, he declined to spend any of his salary on himself.” (RELATED: Do Only 25% Of Americans Support Impeachment, As Trump Claims?) When Kennedy got sworn in as president in 1961, he was the richest man in American history to do so, with his family fortune valued at $1 billion, according to Politico. He too donated his salary to a number of charities, including the Cuban Families Committee, the United Negro College Fund and the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America. Other former presidents, including Barack Obama and George W. Bush, also made considerable charitable donations during their times in office. Forbes estimated Obama contributed over $1 million to charities while he was president, for instance. Trump’s claim that Washington gave away his presidential salary doesn’t hold up either. Washington initially refused a salary but, after Congress insisted that the presidency should not be reserved for only the wealthy, ultimately accepted $25,000 per year.

The administration also lacks directors for the Secret Service, Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), it claims.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The positions of interior secretary, defense secretary and U.N. ambassador are filled in a permanent capacity. Only three positions – ICE director, Homeland Security secretary and White House chief of staff – are helmed by individuals on an acting basis. Fact Check: The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 600 times, uses a list of alleged vacancies in the Trump administration to question President Donald Trump’s ability to serve as president.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “TRUMP CURRENTLY HAS: No Secret Service Director, no Homeland Security Director, no ICE Director, no Secretary of Defense, no Secretary of the Interior, no UN Ambassador, no White House Chief of Staff AND NO CLUE HOW TO RUN AMERICA,” reads the caption. Comedy writer Nick Pappas tweeted out the same claim in April, calling Trump an “isolationist within his own administration.” While the administration was experiencing turnover around that time, it’s inaccurate to describe the positions mentioned the meme, posted Nov. 1, as currently vacant. Four of these positions are permanently filled, and three are held on an acting basis. (RELATED: Has The Trump Admin Fired Over 1,500 VA Employees?) In April, the Senate confirmed then-acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to lead the department on a permanent basis. Mark Esper was sworn in as defense secretary late July, having previously served as the deputy assistant secretary of defense.  Kelly Craft, the current ambassador to the U.N., has held the position since being confirmed by the Senate on July 31, according to the U.S. Mission to the U.N. website. ICE is currently helmed by acting director Matthew Albence, according to the ICE website. Kevin McAleenan was still serving as the acting Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary on Nov. 1, the date the meme was posted, but has since been replaced by Chad Wolf in an acting capacity.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  James Murray, a veteran agent with more than 20 years of experience, was sworn in as the director of the Secret Service in May, according to the Baltimore Sun.

Verdict: False The image shows Connecticut state lawmakers, not members of Congress. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The meme, which has been shared more than 82,000 times, features two legislators playing computer card games and another browsing a sports website while a colleague gives a speech. The caption accompanying the image suggests that the lawmakers are members of Congress. “These are the folks that couldn’t get the budget out by Oct. 1, and are about to control your health care, cap and trade, and the list goes on and on,” reads the caption. “Should we buy them larger screen computers – or – a ticket home, permanently? This is one of their 3-DAY WORK WEEKS that we all pay for (salary is about $179,000 per year).” The image does not, however, depict members of Congress using their computers for entertainment while in session. Taken by photographer Jessica Hill for The Associated Press, it actually shows Connecticut state legislators, according to its caption. “House Minority Leader Lawrence F. Cafero Jr., R-Norwalk, far right, speaks while colleagues play solitaire on their computers as the House convenes to vote on a new budget for the fiscal year in the Capitol, in Hartford, Conn., Monday, Aug., 31, 2009,” reads the caption.  Democratic state Rep.

Meanwhile, base pay for rank-and-file Connecticut legislators is $28,000, according to a 2015 government report.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The photograph has been falsely attributed to Congress and various state legislatures since 2009, according to Snopes.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

No scandals. We sure are going to miss the Obamas.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Well except for the… Fast and Furious scandal, Uranium One scandal, Benghazi scandal, IRS targeting scandal, NSA spying scandal,” reads the bottom half of the meme. “Should I continue?” Verdict: False The Daily Caller found no record of DeGeneres making the statement. It likely got linked to her after an unaffiliated Twitter account called @EllenReaction tweeted the quote. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    DeGeneres has hosted former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama on her daytime talk show “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” numerous times. In January 2017, just a day before President Donald Trump got sworn into office, DeGeneres paid tribute to the Obama family with a video of “her favorite moments” with them. Yet, while DeGeneres often spoke favorably of the Obama family, there is no evidence that DeGeneres said the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. The Daily caller didn’t find any credible online sources linking her to the expression, and resources like TVEyes have no account of her saying it. The statement doesn’t appear on her verified social media accounts either. An internet search revealed numerous instances of Twitter users tweeting the expression around the time of the 2016 presidential election. (RELATED: No, Tribal Leaders Did Not Give Barack Obama A Derogatory Native American Name) “8 years. No scandals. No mistresses. No impeachment hearings. Just class and grace, personified. We sure are going to miss this family,” reads a popular version of the quote. It is often accompanied by an Obama family photo.  The statement likely got attributed to DeGeneres after the Twitter account @EllenReaction tweeted it out, garnering more than 12,000 retweets and 30,000 likes. The account, which has since been suspended, did not disclaim in its bio that it had no affiliation with the host of “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” likely spurring the misattribution. “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” did not respond to a request for comment.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Marx, a 19th century political philosopher, is perhaps best known for co-authoring “The Communist Manifesto” with his long-time colleague Friedrich Engels. His writings have influenced a number of leaders around the world, including the late Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Yet, while he authored many oft-quoted expressions, there is no evidence of Marx ever saying or writing the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The saying does not appear anywhere in his written works. “The quote is not from Marx,” Iowa State University philosophy professor Tony Smith told the Daily Caller in an email. “It’s from a story told about Lenin, but who knows if he said it.” (RELATED: Did Vladimir Lenin Say ‘Socialized Medicine Is The Keystone To The Arch Of A Socialist State’?) The website Quote Investigator examined the origin of the expression and found multiple variations, none of which credibly belong to Marx. A writer named S. Dmitrijewski apparently wrote in a 1931 profile of Soviet diplomat Maxim Litvinov, “The necessary money being given by millionaires, who thereby helped weave the rope from which many of them should hang later on.”  Another variation appeared in a 1955 edition of a California periodical called The Commonwealth, according to Quote Investigator. In that publication, Major George Racey Jordan was quoted as saying, “Lenin wrote, ‘When it comes time to hang the capitalists, they will vie with each other for the rope contract.'” In 1975, Russian novelist and historian Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn delivered a speech that contained an anecdote of Lenin saying variation of the expression, though Solzhenitsyn didn’t provide a credible source for it, according to Quote Investigator.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The saying, Quote Investigator noted, is frequently attributed to Lenin and former Soviet Union leader Joseph Stalin, though there’s “no substantive evidence” it originated with them either.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/amati89/posts/824243098031334,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Marx,https://www.amazon.com/Communist-Manifesto-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140447571,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fidel-Castro,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vladimir-Lenin,http://search.iisg.amsterdam/Search/Results?lookfor=%22last+capitalist+we+hang%22&type=AllFields,https://books.google.com/books?id=nou3DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=karl+marx+complete+works&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj124HExZDmAhUGneAKHTEBA4UQ6AEwAnoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22The%20last%20capitalist%20we%20hang%20shall%20be%20the%20one%20who%20sold%20us%20the%20rope%22&f=false,https://www.google.com/search?btnG=Google+Search%21&as_sitesearch=www.marxists.org%2Farchive%2Fmarx%2Fworks%2F&hl=en&ie=8859-1&oe=8859-1&as_occt=any&num=30%25&as_epq=%22last+capitalist+we+hang%22&as_q=&as_oq=&as_eq=&as_occt=all,https://www.philrs.iastate.edu/directory/tony-smith/,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/05/03/fact-check-vladimir-lenin-socialized-medicine-keystone-arch-socialist-state/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/02/22/rope/#return-note-17998-7,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/02/22/rope/#return-note-17998-7,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maksim-Litvinov,https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt/search?q1=%22When+it+comes+time+to+hang+the+capitalists%2C+they+will+vie+with+each+other+for+the+rope+contract%22&id=uc1.%24b564933&view=1up&seq=274&num=268,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/02/22/rope/#return-note-17998-7,https://www.amazon.com/Majors-Jordans-Diaries-George-Jordan/dp/B003IYNRH8,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/02/22/rope/#return-note-17998-7,https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt/search?q1=%22bourgeoisie%20will%20hang%20itself%22;id=uiug.30112099135169;view=1up;seq=483;start=1;sz=10;page=search;orient=0,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/02/22/rope/#return-note-17998-7,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/02/22/rope/#return-note-17998-7,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e7939582918895a783868e8b9e84868b8b8295c984888a","Did Karl Marx Say, ‘The Last Capitalist We Hang Shall Be The One Who Sold Us The Rope’?",,,,,

Verdict: False Mueller does not have a public Twitter account. The tweet came from a parody account that has since been suspended. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Mueller headed the nearly two-year probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. His 448-page report did not establish that Trump coordinated or conspired with the Russian government but left open the question of whether the president obstructed justice. A viral image falsely alleged in a post that Mueller tweeted in response Trump’s Oct. 26 tweet quoting a remark from Fox News host Tucker Carlson and calling the Russia investigation an “illegal Witch Hunt.” (RELATED: Viral Image Claims That Fox News Isn’t Covering The Mueller Hearings)  “Not a single American citizen has been charged with anything related to Russian Collusion, not one person.” @TuckerCarlson It was all an illegal Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2019  “‘Not a single American citizen has been charged with anything related to Russian Collusion, not one person.’ @TuckerCarlson It was all an illegal Witch Hunt!” tweeted Trump.  “Six former Trump advisers, 26 Russian nationals, three Russian companies, one California man, and one London-based lawyer,” Mueller allegedly responded. “Seven of these people (including five of the six former Trump advisers) have pleaded guilty. All of these charges stem from our investigation.” Yet, while the tweet appears authentic at first glance, it did not come from the former special counsel, but rather an unaffiliated parody account that has since been suspended. Mueller does not have a public Twitter account.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Further adding to the post’s dubiousness, he has been notably tight-lipped when it comes to the Russia investigation. If Mueller had publicly responded to Trump’s tweet, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it. He and his team of prosecutors have indicted 34 individuals, including several with ties to Trump, and three Russian companies on charges ranging from lying to investigators to computer hacking to conspiracy, according to Business Insider.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Its creators have no apparent affiliation with West. Fact Check: West, a self-proclaimed born-again Christian, released his gospel-inspired ninth album “Jesus Is King” last month. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and every song landed on Billboard’s Hot 100, according to Fox News. (RELATED: Was Kanye West Scheduled To Be On ‘Info Wars’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Amid the successful release of his ninth album, a viral image alleged in a post that West published a version of Genesis, the first book of Christian Old Testament, that replaces all instances of the word “God” with “Kanye.” A stylized black-and-gold portrait of West dominates the cover of his supposed “Book of Yeezus,” per the image accompanying the Facebook post. Yet, while “Book of Yeezus” does actually exist, West has no apparent affiliation with its publication. The Daily Caller did not find any media reports tying the rapper to the project financially or otherwise. West has not put out any announcements claiming ownership either. Originally sold on Etsy, the book was created by three U.S.-based brothers in 2015, according to NME. In fact, one of them anonymously told the Christian Post in a phone interview that the rapper had no involvement in the project. “It’s definitely a misconception,” the creator told the Christian Post. “We’re waiting to hear from the guy. We have nothing to do with him.”  “The Book of Yeezus is an interventionist art, coffee-table novelty, that will appeal to Kanye fans everywhere and those made curious by this enormous cultural phenomenon,” reads a description on its official website.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/hlagalovus/posts/3708636955828438,https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8525727/nicki-minaj-kanye-west-born-again-christian,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/arts/music/kanye-west-jesus-is-king.html,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-album-1-billboard,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/05/04/fact-check-kanye-west-infowars/https://checkyourfact.com/2018/05/04/fact-check-kanye-west-infowars/,https://www.facebook.com/hlagalovus/posts/3708636955828438,https://www.facebook.com/hlagalovus/posts/3708636955828438,http://bookofyeezus.com/,http://defjampress.com/artist/kanye-west/,https://www.etsy.com/ie/listing/218344545/?ref=shop_home_active_1,https://www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-360-1220305,https://www.etsy.com/ie/listing/218344545/?ref=shop_home_active_1,https://www.christianpost.com/news/man-who-published-kanye-west-bible-replacing-god-with-rappers-name-hits-back-at-critics-as-sales-soar-exclusive.html,http://bookofyeezus.com/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ffbfdeaf9e0fdcfebeee6e3f6eceee3e3eafda1ece0e2",‘Book Of Yeezus’ – Did Kanye West Publish A Bible That Replaces ‘God’ With His Name?,,,,,

Adam Schiff used tax dollars to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit with a 19-year-old man.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence Schiff settled a sexual harassment claim with tax dollars. The Daily Caller only found the claim posted on conspiracy theory social media accounts and satire websites. Fact Check:  Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has become a popular target for misinformation since the House initiated a formal impeachment investigation against President Donald Trump. (RELATED: Are George Soros And Adam Schiff In-Laws?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The meme, which has been shared more than 1,300 times, alleges that Schiff sexually harassed a young man and used tax dollars to settle the lawsuit. “Adam Schiff used taxpayer money to reach sexual harassment settlement with a 19 year old male,” reads the caption. “Retweet if you are sick of this disgraceful hypocrite trashing our president.” There is, however, no evidence that Schiff has ever settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with another man. The Caller did not find any House Ethics Committee reports about sexual misconduct from the California congressman, and no news outlets have reported on it either. Further adding to the post’s dubiousness, Congress passed a law in 2018 that makes lawmakers personally financially liable for sexual harassment payments and prohibits them from using taxpayer dollars in such settlements. “This false smear originated four months ago on a QAnon conspiracy account,” a spokesman for Schiff told PolitiFact in March. “It is obviously and categorically untrue.”  In December 2018, a QAnon conspiracy theory account did indeed tweet the claim, citing unnamed “congressional sources.” That tweet and a number of others went viral, and their claims subsequently migrated to Facebook. A similar claim also appeared in a satirical article posted on TheNetSpies, a website that disclaims it publishes content with “a bit of satire for laughs.” The article, posted in February 2018, claims Schiff abused a supposed “gay lover,” crediting an editor at the Los Angeles Times with providing the site with the exclusive story.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Christina Bellantoni, the former Los Angeles Times editor mentioned in the article, called it “seriously fake news” on Twitter a few months later.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Trump has become a popular subject for digitally manipulated images on social media in recent years. This particular Facebook page, Historical Pictures, claims to show a childhood photograph of Trump dating back to 1952. (RELATED: Does This Picture Show Trump With E. Jean Carroll?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Daily Caller did not find any credible media reports containing the image, and it only seems to show up on meme websites. A search of Trump’s verified social media accounts didn’t return any matching pictures either. Snopes, a fact-checking website, determined that the picture is a doctored version of a screen grab from Trump’s April 1988 interview with Oprah Winfrey. Someone used Snapchat’s “Baby Filter” to make Trump look like a toddler. A black-and-white filter has also been applied to age the picture, according to Snopes. During that 1988 interview, Winfrey asked Trump, who was in his early 40s at the time, whether he would ever consider running for president. “Probably not, but I do get tired of seeing the country ripped off,” answered Trump. “I just don’t think I really have the inclination to do it. I love what I’m doing, I really like it.”  Trump posted an actual childhood picture on Instagram in August 2013.               View this post on Instagram                     Who knew this innocent kid would grow into a monster? #TBT #Trump A post shared by  President Donald J.

Verdict: False No such Supreme Court ruling exists. The story likely comes from a satire article published in 2014. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Founded in 1846, the Smithsonian Institution is a large museum and research complex with 17 museums, galleries and a zoo in the Washington, D.C. area, according to its website. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show The Crowd At The ‘Storm Area 51’ Event?) The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 100 times, claims that the Supreme Court ordered the Smithsonian to disclose that it destroyed giant human skeletons to “protect the mainstream chronology of human evolution.” However, the Daily Caller did not find any news reports of the Supreme Court ruling on such a case, and resources like the Supreme Court database turned up no matches either. The only two Supreme Court cases related to the museum complex – Smithsonian Institution v. St. John and Smithsonian Institution v. Meech – had nothing to do with evolution. The story, debunked by Snopes in 2014, likely stems from an article on World News Daily Report, a site that publishes “satirical” and “fictional” content, according to its disclaimer. The article, entitled “Smithsonian Admits To Destruction Of Thousands Of Giant Human Skeletons In Early 1900s,” offers a similar but more detailed story of a supposed evolutionary cover-up.  Various hoaxes about the discovery of giant human remains have been circulating online since at least 2002, according to the National Geographic Society.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

His estate at Mount Vernon labels it a “spurious quotation.” Fact Check:  Washington, like many of the founding fathers, is often credited with expressions he never actually said or wrote. The specific quote about agriculture appears to be one such example. (RELATED: Did George Washington Say This Quote About A ‘Government’s Right To Govern’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Indeed, there is no record of Washington ever making the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched the Papers of George Washington and the National Archives online database for the expression but turned up no matches. It doesn’t appear anywhere in his correspondence or recorded speeches either. Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon includes the saying on its “spurious quotations” page, with the entry reading, “The library has yet to find an explanation for this misquote or locate another individual who said this statement.” While there is little evidence that Washington ever said or wrote the expression, he did hold agricultural work in high regard. In a 1794 letter to John Sinclair, Washington wrote, “I know of no pursuit in which more zeal & important service can be rendered to any Country than by improving its agriculture – its breed of useful animals – and other branches of a husbandman’s cares.” The misattributed quote has appeared in agricultural publications since at least the 1830s, according to Mount Vernon.

It actually comes from an anonymous essay published in 1753 that was likely written by John Hawkesworth. Fact Check: Swift, an Anglo-Irish writer active during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, is perhaps best known for writing “Gulliver’s Travels” and “A Modest Proposal.” (RELATED: ‘The Trick Is Not To Expect It But To Delight In It When It Comes’ – Did Charles Dickens Say This Quote About Happiness?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While Swift did explore various elements of the human condition in his writings, there is no evidence that he authored the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his complete works didn’t turn up any matching or similar phrases. The Daily Caller reached out to several experts, all of whom confirmed the quote did not come from Swift. “In fact it sounds like something Swift would NOT say,” Leo Damrosch, a literature professor at Harvard University, told the Caller in an email. “He was deeply suspicious of romantic love and always insisted that strong friendship was better.” Other experts – Penn State Brandywine professor Paul deGategno and Hillsdale College professor Dutton Kearney – told the Caller that the statement comes from an anonymous article published in a March 1753 edition of a London-based journal. “It’s from The Adventurer, Essay Number 36,” said Kearney in an email to the Caller. “Swift never wrote for this journal.”  Hawkesworth, one of the publication’s founders, may have actually authored the saying, according to deGategno.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157125258933924&set=a.10156374314253924&type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Hawkesworth,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jonathan-Swift,https://www.amazon.com/Gullivers-Travels-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486292738,https://www.amazon.com/Modest-Proposal-Jonathan-Swift/dp/1603863559/ref=asc_df_1603863559/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312174407663&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4766262929650761242&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061285&hvtargid=aud-799728744414:pla-570004447600&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=60258870857&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=312174407663&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=4766262929650761242&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061285&hvtargid=aud-799728744414:pla-570004447600,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/07/fact-check-charles-dickens-happiness-gift-trick-expect-delight/,https://oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=c8zk5n35&developer=local&style=oac4&s=1&query=%22love+without+esteem%22&x=0&y=0&servlet=view,https://books.google.com/books?id=62gbAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1&dq=complete+works+jonathan+swift&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjCo5jP6IjmAhWjs1kKHZ-_Baw4ChDoATAHegQICRAC#v=snippet&q=capricious%20and%20volatile&f=false,https://english.fas.harvard.edu/search/site/damrosch?&solrsort=%20,https://brandywine.psu.edu/person/paul-degategno,https://www.hillsdale.edu/faculty/dutton-kearney/,https://books.google.com/books?id=KWEsWxF9ZdUC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=A+love+without+esteem+is+capricious+and+volatile;+esteem+without+love+is+languid+and+cold+john+hawkesworth&source=bl&ots=LAh53ps_jA&sig=ACfU3U15Yy6_0SliWCij_U4keSpstrBzjA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8lvSYsYjmAhWPrFkKHa6hBP4Q6AEwA3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22a%20love%20without%20esteem%20is%20capricious%20and%20volatile%2C%20esteem%20without%20love%20is%20languid%20and%20cold%22%20&f=false,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#33474156455c417357525a5f4a50525f5f56411d505c5e","Did Jonathan Swift Say, ‘A Love Without Esteem Is Capricious And Volatile; Esteem Without Love Is Languid And Cold’?",,,,,

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar have vowed to take benefits like Social Security and Medicare away from senior citizens.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The Daily Caller found no evidence Ocasio-Cortez or Omar ever called for such action. The claim actually comes from an article published on a satire website. Fact Check: Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have become popular targets for fake news since their respective elections to Congress in 2018. This particular meme purports that the freshman congresswomen have promised to take benefits away from senior citizens. (RELATED: Did Ilhan Omar Say, ‘Trump Is Taking Benefits Away From Black Americans By Giving Them Jobs’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Ocasio-Cortez And Omar Vow To Remove Senior’s ‘Entitlements,’ Social Security/Medicare Calling seniors dead weight!” reads the Facebook image. However, no credible sources have linked Ocasio-Cortez or Omar to policy proposals of this nature. Such a vow does not appear on either of their Twitter accounts or ProPublica’s archive of their deleted tweets. The congressional record has no account of either proposing the cuts either. In fact, both congresswomen have actually called for “Medicare for All,” a single-payer, government-run health insurance program that would cover all Americans. Ocasio-Cortez also recently released a video calling for the House to vote on a bill that would expand Social Security benefits. The claim may originate with a satirical article published on Daily World Update, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.”  Though Daily World Update has a disclaimer noting that it’s a satire website, the meme shared on Facebook not only fails to issue a similar warning, it deceptively insists that the claim is real.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It appears to be a photoshopped screen grab of another article. Fact Check: Demonstrations erupted across Hong Kong in June after the government proposed a bill to allow extradition to mainland China. Though they began as protests against the now-withdrawn legislation, the demonstrations have since evolved into a broader movement for the region’s autonomy.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Numerous media outlets have reported on the escalating clashes between Hong Kong police and pro-democracy activists in the past few months. (RELATED: Does This Image Show Trash Left By Climate Change Protesters In Chicago?) The alleged article, which was screen grabbed and posted on Facebook, masquerades as a piece of BBC News content, with the headline, “Hong Kong protester arrested for using giant spoon against water gun vehicles.” It also includes a picture of a person wearing a respirator and holding a large spoon. At first glance, the article appears authentic. It bears the BBC News logo, while also mimicking the format typically used by the BBC News mobile website. However, it appears to be a photoshopped screen grab of another article. The Daily Caller found no record of the alleged article on the BBC News website nor on any of the network’s social media accounts. A search for media reports of Hong Kong protesters using unusual tools to protect themselves from police also yielded no results.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Chapman, known as the star of reality television show “Dog the Bounty Hunter,” learned in September on an episode of “The Dr. Oz Show” that he was suffering from a pulmonary embolism, according to the Denver Post.

There’s no evidence that her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, is related to George Soros in any way. Fact Check: The Clinton family and billionaire Democratic donor George Soros have been the subjects of conspiracy theories for years. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show George Soros In A Nazi Uniform)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This Facebook post alleges that, through the marriage of Chelsea Clinton to her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, the Clintons have a secret connection to George Soros. “Marc Mezvinsky & wife Chelsea,” reads the caption. “”He is also George Soros’ nephew.” Actress Roseanne Barr made a similar claim on Twitter last year. The tweet, which has since been deleted, simply said, “Chelsea Soros Clinton.” (She later tweeted a correction, but that has also been deleted.) Shortly after Barr tweeted the claim, Chelsea Clinton debunked it on Twitter.  Good morning Roseanne – my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soros’s nephews are lovely people. I’m just not married to one. I am grateful for the important work @OpenSociety does in the world. Have a great day! https://t.co/mXokiTEwN7 — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) May 29, 2018   “Good morning Roseanne – my given middle name is Victoria. I imagine George Soros’s nephews are lovely people. I’m just not married to one. I am grateful for the important work @OpenSociety does in the world. Have a great day!” tweeted Chelsea Clinton. Chelsea Clinton married Marc Mezvinsky in July 2010. He is not related to George Soros, contrary to what the Facebook post claims.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  His parents are Edward Mezvinsky and Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, former Democratic representatives of Iowa and Pennsylvania respectively, according to The New York Times. He only has one uncle, Norton Mezvinsky, according to New York Daily News. George Soros has two nephews, Peter and Jeffrey, by way of his older brother Paul, according to the biography “Soros: The Life and Times of a Messianic Billionaire.” Neither are married to Chelsea Clinton – Jeffrey Soros married Catharine Cosover in 1995 and Peter Soros married Flora Fraser in 1997. Fraser and Peter Soros reportedly separated in 2009. The Daily Caller found no media reports linking the Clinton, Soros and Mezvinsky families together in this manner, except for those debunking Barr’s tweet.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    An award-winning actor and director known for films such as “Dirty Harry” and “Gran Torino,” Eastwood has been active politically during his career. He endorsed Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney during their respective 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, according to ABC News. The image, which has been shared more than 6,200 times, alleges that Eastwood wrote a long statement praising Trump. “I love him as our President,” reads part of Eastwood’s supposed statement. “No one is without fault. We hired a man to do a job. He has surpassed my expectations in record time, single handedly (sic) fighting the establishment.” There is, however, no evidence that Eastwood ever said or wrote this long statement. The Daily Caller found no credible sources linking the statement to the “Million Dollar Baby” actor, and Eastwood does not appear to have any social media accounts. (RELATED: Did Steve Harvey Author This Pro-Trump Statement?) “The statement… has been falsely attributed to our client Clint Eastwood,” said Eastwood’s lawyer, John Marks, in an email to the Caller. “We do not know if any other person genuinely made this statement, or if it has been manufactured, but in either case, it is not anything our client has stated or written.”  Eastwood has made public statements about Trump in the past. During a 2016 Esquire magazine interview, he said that given a choice between Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, he would vote for Trump. Yet, while Eastwood appeared to express a preference for Trump in that interview, he has since also said that he “stayed out of it” and that both 2016 presidential candidates had a “certain degree of insanity.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157086128752670&set=a.10150158150082670&type=3&theater,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/awards?ref_=nm_awd,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066999/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_39,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1205489/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4,https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/clint-eastwood-endorses-romney,https://www.google.com/search?biw=1283&bih=673&sxsrf=ACYBGNTTtFGjmMT37AoQASrH5ji16yjLAA%3A1574706857604&ei=qR7cXbi2JMPE-gTlqLKoDw&q=Clint+Eastwood+Trump+%22I+love+him+as+our+president%22&oq=Clint+Eastwood+Trump+%22I+love+him+as+our+president%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3...1071.12080..12651...0.0..0.127.938.0j8......0....1..gws-wiz.CxKaPbY_O7g&ved=0ahUKEwj4rv2WgIbmAhVDop4KHWWUDPUQ4dUDCAs&uact=5,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/09/fact-check-did-steve-harvey-author-this-pro-trump-statement/,https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a46893/double-trouble-clint-and-scott-eastwood/,https://extratv.com/2016/09/08/is-clint-eastwood-supporting-donald-trump-not-so-fast/,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-0904-sneaks-sully-20160828-snap-story.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f6828493809984b692979f9a8f95979a9a9384d895999b",‘Why I Stick My Neck Out For Trump’ – Did Clint Eastwood Author This Pro-Trump Statement?,,,,,

His estate at Monticello considers it a “spurious quotation.” Fact Check: Social media users erroneously ascribe quotes to Jefferson so often that his estate at Monticello keeps a running list of “spurious quotations.” A quick internet search revealed that the quote about attitude appears on that list. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, ‘That Government Is Best Which Governs The Least’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller found no record of Jefferson ever saying or writing the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson did not yield any results, nor did a search of his collected letters and quotations. “It is also frequently attributed to W. W. Ziege, and while Ziege did write an article that appeared in Rosicrucian Digest in December 1945, ‘The Magic Word,’ in which he essentially makes the same point, he did not use these exact words,” wrote Research Librarian Anna Berkes on the Monticello website. “No other writings of his in which this quotation may have appeared have yet been located.” Indeed, the website Quote Investigator found a semantically-related statement in Ziege’s 1945 article, though elements of the expression also appeared earlier. In the Rosicrucian Digest, Ziege wrote, “Changing the mental attitude from the wrong to the right is all that people need to do to enjoy all that life has to offer.” The quote about attitude has been attributed to Jefferson since at least 1988, according to Berkes.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Dali, a Spanish surrealist artist, lived during the 20th century. While many people know him for his paintings, like his 1931 piece “The Persistence of Memory,” he also produced work in sculpture, photography and writing.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in his writings does the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appear. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched his short stories, books and screenplays for the quote but found no matches. The DCNF also reached out to several experts, none of whom were able to provide a definitive citation in Dali’s work. “It is so often mentioned but it’s quite possible it’s not correct,” Elliott King, an art historian with expertise in Dali, told the DCNF in an email. The website Quote Investigator found a precursor to the statement in a 1908 article by Walter Cottingham, though elements of the expression appeared earlier. An exact match for the quote was published in the 1997 collection “Reader’s Digest Quotable Quotes,” where it was attributed to “C. Archie Danielson,” according to Quote Investigator.  “The quotation appeared in an alphabetical listing of quotations in which statements from Dali and Danielson were contiguous,” speculates Quote Investigator. “An ascription was listed below each quotation. An inattentive reader grouped the quotation with Dali instead of Danielson by looking above the expression instead of below.” Despite the lack of evidence linking the quote to Dali, it is still widely attributed to him on the internet.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The article originally comes from a satire website. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Pelosi, the Democratic House Speaker, often draws the ire of conservatives. In this case, the article attempts to paint Pelosi as disingenuous with her donors and constituents. (RELATED: Did Nancy Pelosi Say, ‘Waiting Hours Longer In The Waiting Room Will Allow You To Make New Friends’?) The article, which has been widely shared on Facebook, alleges that Pelosi promised, among other things, free electricity and tax reductions to attendees at an Illinois fundraiser. Afterwards, she was caught on a hot mic speaking to her aide, according to the article. “Trump proved how dense Republican voters are and I guess I just left no doubt that Democrats are the same,” the article quotes Pelosi as saying to her aide. “Americans are the stupidest people on earth.” However, there is no evidence that Pelosi ever made the statement attributed to her in the article. The Daily Caller did not find any news reports in which the quote appears, and resources like ProPublica’s archive of her public statements turned up no matches either.  The article was originally published late October on Bustatroll.org, a parody news website that describes itself as part of a network that publishes “parody, satire, and tomfoolery.” While Bustatroll.org clearly disclaims the satirical nature of its content, other websites that picked up the article failed to do the same.

It was superimposed onto a 2014 image of James wearing an “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirt. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    James, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has been active in promoting social justice issues in recent years. For instance, he expressed public support for former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeling during the national anthem. (RELATED: Image Claims To Show Former NFL Players Joe Namath And Al Woodall Kneeling During The National Anthem) The viral image, which has been shared more than 55,000 times, depicts James wearing a “Same Crime” t-shirt that attempts to express the disparities in punishment among different races and police officers. However, it has been photoshopped. A reverse image search revealed that the original image, which has been flipped and cropped, actually shows James wearing a t-shirt with the words “I Can’t Breathe.” Getty photographer Al Bello took the picture before a 2014 Cleveland Cavaliers game against the Brooklyn Nets, according to the caption. (He played for the Cavaliers at the time.) NEW YORK, NY – DECEMBER 08: LeBron James #23 of the Cleveland Cavaliers wears an “I Can’t Breathe” shirt during warmups before his game against the Brooklyn Nets during their game at the Barclays Center on December 8, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by Al Bello/Getty Images) In 2014, James made national headlines for donning the “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirt in honor of Eric Garner, a black man who died after being put in a chokehold by a New York police officer. If James had worn the “Same Crime” t-shirt, it would also have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it.

They are the biggest threats to America.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Deplorable and Damn proud of it,” the caption reads. “God Bless the USA.” Verdict: False The Daily Caller found no record of Clinton ever making the statement. It seems to have originated on a satirical Facebook page. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Clinton has become a popular target for fake quotes online. In this case, the meme credits her with coining a negative statement about supporters of President Donald Trump, suggesting that she said it May 16 at the University of California, Berkeley. “We must guard the future from the idiocy and ignorance of the Trump deplorables,” the Facebook post quotes Clinton as saying. “They are the biggest threats to America.” (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton Once Say That ‘Democratic Voters Are Just Plan Stupid?’) Yet, while she did refer to some Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables” during a 2016 fundraiser, there are no credible sources linking Clinton to the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. Searching the Berkeley News and Berkeley Events websites turned up no evidence that Clinton gave a speech at the university in May of this year or any other. The quote, debunked by Snopes in 2018, appears to have originated with America’s Last Line of Defense, a Facebook page known for creating and spreading satirical content. The page clearly disclaims that it is satirical in nature, noting, “Nothing on this page is real.”  Not only does the meme, posted Nov. 20, fail to make the same disclosure, it also deceptively portrays the quote as real.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The Daily Caller found no evidence that Obama ever received the name. Versions of the story have been circulating online since the early 2000s. Fact Check: Obama, the 44th president, met with Native American leaders on numerous occasions during his tenure in the Oval Office. (RELATED: Did Obama Award The Presidential Medal Of Freedom To Clinton, Cosby, Weiner And Weinstein?) The Facebook post, which features a picture from Obama’s 2008 visit with the Crow Nation in Montana, alleges that upstate New York tribal leaders bestowed upon Obama a disparaging Native American name after he gave a speech to a “major gathering of the American Indian Nation.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “A reporter later asked the group of chiefs how they came to select the new name,” reads the Facebook post. “They explained that ‘Walking Eagle’ is the name given to a bird so full of sh*t it can no longer fly.” There is, however, no evidence that Obama ever received that name from Native American tribal leaders. An internet search turned up no credible sources reporting the events described in the Facebook post. There does not appear to be any federally-recognized tribal organization named “American Indian Nation” either, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs website. Other political figures, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former President George W. Bush and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, have been the subject of similar internet stories over the years. Obama did receive a Native American name in 2008, but it was not derogatory in nature. The Crow Nation dubbed him “One Who Helps People Throughout the Land” during an adoption ceremony into the tribe, according to The New York Times.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=696315220853708&set=gm.1705513972914891&type=3&theater,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/26/fact-sheet-8th-annual-white-house-tribal-nations-conference,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/07/18/fact-check-obama-presidential-medal-freedom-clinton-cosby-weiner-weinstein/,https://www.flickr.com/photos/barackobamadotcom/2507067918/in/album-72157605149373497/,https://www.flickr.com/photos/barackobamadotcom/albums/72157605149373497,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=696315220853708&set=gm.1705513972914891&type=3&theater,https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Obama%22+%22New+York%22+%22Native+American%22&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwix2uHOtYjmAhXhqlkKHRaaDnM4ChD8BSgBegQIDBAD&biw=635&bih=716,https://www.bia.gov/tribal-leaders-directory,https://www.connectingsingles.com/blog_86871_1/hillary_honored_by_apaches_indians.htm,https://greenerblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/george-walking-eagle-bush.html,https://twitter.com/STUinSD/status/1148606635050524672,http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/05/19/scenes-from-the-trail-obama-in-montana/,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/19/obama-adopted-by-native-americans/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91e5e3f4e7fee3d1f5f0f8fde8f2f0fdfdf4e3bff2fefc","No, Tribal Leaders Didn’t Give Barack Obama A Derogatory Native American Name",,,,,

It actually comes from John Innes Clark Hare’s book “American Constitutional Law.” Fact Check:  The image, posted Nov. 22, features a screen grab of a tweet from White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump. The tweet, in which she ascribes a quote about impeachment to Tocqueville, comes as her father, President Donald Trump, faces an impeachment inquiry over a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });     “A decline of public morals in the United States will probably be marked by the abuse of the power of impeachment as a means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office.” Alexis de Tocqueville, 1835 — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) November 21, 2019   “A decline of public morals in the United States will probably be marked by the abuse of the power of impeachment as a means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office,” she credits Tocqueville with saying. However, the quote does not appear in his canonical work “Democracy in America,” or any of his other writings. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched his collected works for the expression but found no matches. (RELATED: Did Alexis de Tocqueville Say, ‘The American Republic Will Endure Until The Day Congress Discovers That It Can Bribe The Public With The Public’s Money’?) Harvey Mansfield, author of “Tocqueville: A Very Short Introduction,” told the DCNF in an email that while there is no record of it in Tocqueville’s writings, the saying does express a similar sentiment to a line from Mansfield’s translation of “Democracy in America.”  In his translation, Tocqueville writes, “One should remark in the first place that in the United States the tribunal that pronounces these judgments is composed of the same elements and is subject to the same influences as the body charged with accusing, which gives an almost irresistible impetus to the vindictive passions of the parties.” “He is contrasting the mildness of American impeachment, just ejecting from office, with the harshness of jailing or killing the accused executive as punishments in European governments,” Mansfield explained in an email to the DCNF.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The expression, debunked by numerous media outlets, actually comes from Hare’s 1888 book “American Constitutional Law,” though the wording varies slightly. “It was long since remarked by De Tocqueville that a decline of public morals in the United States would probably be marked by the abuse of power of impeachment as a means of crushing political adversaries or ejecting them from office,” wrote Hare. In his book, Hare was not directly quoting Tocqueville but rather paraphrasing Tocqueville’s views on impeachment in his own words to make a point about former President Andrew Johnson’s 1868 impeachment. It’s possible that readers mistook his characterization of Tocqueville’s writing as a direct quote and subsequently attributed it to the 19th century French author and political scientist.

Fact Check: Adopted in 1923, the U.S. Flag Code provides guidelines on how to properly treat and display the American flag. Many states, including Texas, have their own flag codes as well.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A popular legend claims that, because Texas was once an independent nation, it is the only state that can fly its flag at the same height at the U.S. flag. The Facebook post, which has garnered nearly 300 likes, makes a similar claim. However, any state can fly its flag side-by-side with the American flag at the same height, with some provisions.

No state flag can “be placed above or, if on the same level, to the right of the flag of the United States of America,” according to the U.S. Flag Code. Texas state code makes other stipulations: the flags should be displayed on flagpoles of equal height, and the flags themselves should be of approximately equal size. The American flag must be displayed in the center and higher than other flags when flown with multiple state flags on separate flagpoles, according to the U.S. Flag Code. Similarly, it must be flown at the top when sharing the same flagpole.

Fact Check:  Border Patrol agents at the southern border with Mexico apprehend approximately 1,300 migrants attempting to enter the U.S illegally per day. In fiscal 2019, Border Patrol made more than 851,000 border arrests – the highest number of arrests since fiscal 2007.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    CBP reported only 35,444 apprehensions in October, the month with the most recent data. That figure is down more than 73% from May, when CBP reported 132,856 apprehensions. Border arrest numbers typically peak in the spring, when the weather is most favorable for crossings, only to decline in the summer and winter months, when temperatures are more extreme and less favorable for crossing.  (Credit: Brad Sylvester/ the Daily Caller News Foundation) Additionally, October marked the first time in 18 months that the majority of apprehensions and “inadmissible aliens” was made up of Mexican nationals and not those from Northern Triangle countries, according to Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Commissioner Mark Morgan. Apprehensions of single adults also surpassed families. Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador make up the Northern Triangle. Migrants from these Central American countries have made up the majority of illegal border crossers in recent years. “We have launched historic and unprecedented action to secure our border,” Trump said during the rally, touting the drop in apprehensions as evidence that policy changes implemented by his administration have successfully reduced illegal border crossings.  The Trump administration implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program in January. The initiative, commonly referred to as Remain in Mexico, requires asylum seekers to go back to Mexico while their claims are processed in the U.S. immigration court system. Prior to its implementation, asylum seekers that illegally crossed the border prior to filing their claims were allowed to stay in the U.S. while their applications processed. (RELATED: Can Non-Citizens Apply For Asylum At A US Embassy?) The MPP program has significantly contributed to the decrease in the number of illegal border crossings, according to immigrant think tanks and Trump administration officials. Metering, which restricts the number of migrants who can legally enter the U.S. and request asylum, and a slew of other policies have also played a role.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “The Migrant Protection Protocols has been a key component to the success we have had addressing the crisis,” said former Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in an October statement. However, some asylum officers and immigration advocacy groups have criticized the policy for being unsafe and possibly illegal. “It places migrants in direct danger. They face high rates of kidnapping, murder, disappearances, extortion, and sexual violence – at the hands of organized crime and Mexican enforcement agencies,” reads an infographic from the Latin American Working Group, a nonprofit immigration advocacy group. Morgan credited increased cooperation from the Northern Triangle countries and Mexico, which has stepped up deportations of migrants and increased enforcement on its southern border in recent months, with helping stem the flow of migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border as well.

Fact Check: This isn’t the first time CNN has been the subject of viral misinformation on Facebook. Earlier this month, a post alleged that “CNN Tonight” host Don Lemon called Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi an “unarmed father of three” during a live broadcast. (RELATED: Did CNN’s Don Lemon Call al-Baghdadi An ‘Unarmed Father of Three’ During An Oct. 27 Broadcast?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image, posted Oct. 23, allegedly shows a CNN chyron beneath a photograph of an assault-style weapon. “Breaking News,” reads the supposed still from one of the network’s broadcasts. “CNN Exclusive: Democrats ask, ‘Why even have a Second Ammendment (sic)?'” Yet, while CNN has extensively covered the subject of gun control on its broadcasts and website, there is no record of the cable news network ever airing this news chyron. No matching or similar graphics appear in Grabien, a video clip editing service. Searching CNN’s website didn’t turn up any exclusive reports on Democrats questioning the usefulness of the Second Amendment either. In a 2017 video, former Republican Wisconsin Rep. Sean Duffy told anchor Chris Cuomo that Democrats want to “eradicate the Second Amendment,” but at no point did CNN use the chyron in the Facebook post. A CNN spokesperson confirmed to PolitiFact that the chyron had, in fact, been fabricated.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

531,,,,False,,,,checkyourfact,,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/11/25/fact-check-kaiser-permanente-bernard-tyson-death-flu-vaccine-shot/,Did The Kaiser Permanente CEO Die Just Days After Getting A Flu Shot?,2019-11-25,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: Did The Kaiser Permanente CEO Die Just Days After Getting A Flu Shot?12:10 PM 11/25/2019Trevor Schakohl | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsA Facebook post shared more than 200 times claims that the late Kaiser Permanente CEO Bernard Tyson died just days after receiving a flu shot.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Tyson died shortly after receiving the flu vaccine. A Kaiser Permanente spokesman called the story “completely false.” Fact Check: Tyson, the chairman and CEO of health care provider Kaiser Permanente, died unexpectedly in his sleep on Nov. 10. (RELATED: Trump Says Health Care Premiums Are Dropping Under His Watch)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 200 times, includes a screen grab of a tweet from Tyson’s verified social media page, showing him receiving a flu vaccination. The tweet dates back to October 2018. “When the CEO of Kaiser dies in his sleep a few days after publicly taking a flu vaccine,” reads the Facebook caption. “At age 60.” However, there is no evidence that Tyson died after receiving a flu shot. An internet search shows no credible media outlets reporting that a flu vaccine played a role in his death. To date, neither Kaiser Permanente nor his family has disclosed the cause of his death. John Nelson, the vice president of communications for Kaiser Permanente, confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the claim was false.  “He passed away suddenly, leaving his family, friends and colleagues grieving,” wrote Nelson in an email to the Caller. “His memory deserves better than a completely false story created by people who know nothing about him or the circumstances of his passing.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone six months of age and older get the annual flu vaccine.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Common side effects of the flu shot include low-grade fever, headaches, fatigue and soreness at the site of the injection, according to the CDC. Life-threatening allergic reactions and Guillain-Barre syndrome can occur after receiving the vaccine, but they are extremely uncommon and rarely fatal, according to Peter Hotez, the dean of Baylor College of Medicine’s National School of Tropical Medicine. “It is exceedingly rare for someone to die of a reaction to a flu vaccine, far far less than those who die from not being vaccinated and dying from flu, which are thousands per year,” said John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor Albert Wu in an email to the Caller. Approximately 45 percent of adults in the U.S. got the flu vaccine during the 2018-2019 season, according to the CDC. A study from the CDC found that flu vaccinations prevented an estimated 7.1 million flu illnesses and 8,000 flu-related deaths during the 2017-2018 season. Tyson was a vocal advocate of vaccinating against the flu, having tweeted numerous times about its importance in protecting people from contracting the virus.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10217708846487185&set=a.1108795434356&type=3&theater,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/obituaries/kaiser-permanente-ceo-bernard-tyson-dead-age-60-n1079536,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/12/18/fact-check-trump-health-care-premiums-drop/,https://twitter.com/BernardJTyson/status/1047261258842603520,https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=dzTYXfClHenF0PEPjJCdoA0&q=%22bernard+tyson%22+AND+%22flu%22+AND+%22death%22&oq=%22bernard+tyson%22+AND+%22flu%22+AND+%22death%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160.1825.13178..13551...8.0..0.185.5565.0j42......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i131j0j0i3j0i131i70i251j0i22i30j33i299j33i22i29i30.Kqnakwy4uKA&ved=0ahUKEwiwvdC0xP7lAhXpIjQIHQxIB9QQ4dUDCAg&uact=5,https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Bernard-Tyson-Kaiser-Permanente-CEO-dead-at-60-14824231.php,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccinesafety.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/flushot.htm#sideeffects,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/guillainbarre.htm,https://www.bcm.edu/people/view/peter-hotez-m-d-ph-d/b1846a47-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6,https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/771/albert-wu,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/coverage-1819estimates.htm,https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/burden-averted.htm,https://twitter.com/BernardJTyson/status/908914823676649472,https://twitter.com/BernardJTyson/status/1047261258842603520,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a7d3d5c2d1c8d5e7c3c6cecbdec4c6cbcbc2d589c4c8ca",Did The Kaiser Permanente CEO Die Just Days After Getting A Flu Shot?,,,,,

All professional football players used to do this, the post claims. Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The picture shows the two players kneeling during a game that was already in progress. There is no evidence that it was common practice for NFL players to kneel during the anthem before 2016. Fact Check: In August 2016, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the pre-game playing of the national anthem in protest of racism against “black people and people of color.” Other NFL players, as well as professional athletes in the NBA and NHL, followed suit and protested their pre-game playing of the national anthem. President Donald Trump criticized the practice in late September 2016, calling the practice a “total disrespect of our heritage.” He also suggested the protestor-players should be fired for kneeling during the national anthem. (RELATED: Did NFL Linebacker James Harrison Make This Remark About The Anthem Protests?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which features an old photograph of Namath and Woodall supposedly kneeling during the national anthem, uses the image to criticize the Trump administration’s reaction to the protests. “All the players used to kneel for the National Anthem,” reads the caption. “Now do you understand the ignorance of the current administration and his minions?” The image does not, however, show Namath and his teammate kneeling during the playing of the national anthem, contrary to the post’s claim. A reverse image search revealed the photo, which comes from The New York Times, was actually taken in the third quarter of a 1973 game, long after the anthem would have been played, per notes on the back of the original picture. The Daily Caller found no evidence that it was common for players to kneel prior to Kaepernick doing it in 2016. NFL players only began standing on the field for the pre-game rendition of the national anthem in 2009, according to Axios. Before that, teams stayed in their locker rooms, except during the Super Bowl and after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. Namath has expressed support for protestor-players in Fox News interviews but has said that the American flag must be respected as well.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3148459875180644&set=gm.1149997488540006&type=3&theater,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem,http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem,https://dailycaller.com/2017/09/22/trump-on-nfl-anthem-kneelers-get-that-son-of-a-b-off-the-field-video/,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/911904261553950720,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/12/fact-check-nfl-james-harrison-national-anthem-protests/,https://livelymorgue.tumblr.com/post/18494959953/nov-11-1973-joe-namath-in-furs-and-al,https://livelymorgue.tumblr.com/post/18494959953/nov-11-1973-joe-namath-in-furs-and-al,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/taking-a-knee-national-anthem-nfl-trump-why-meaning-origins-racism-us-colin-kaepernick-a8521741.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEWOi0yDj3Q,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#becaccdbc8d1ccfedadfd7d2c7dddfd2d2dbcc90ddd1d3",Viral Image Claims To Show Former NFL Players Joe Namath And Al Woodall Kneeling During The National Anthem,,,,,

The Russians simply used pencils, it also claims.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Both U.S. astronauts and Russian cosmonauts used pencils in their early space flights but have since transitioned to using Fisher Space Pens. The company developed the pens without funding from NASA. Fact Check: The Facebook post, which has been shared more than a thousand times, perpetuates a popular urban legend that, upon discovering ballpoint pens did not work in zero gravity, NASA spent millions of tax dollars developing functional writing utensils for space missions. (RELATED: Does The US Have The Most Military Satellites In Space?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “[When] NASA started sending astronauts to space they quickly discovered that ballpoint pens would not work in zero gravity,” reads the Facebook post. “To combat this problem Congress approved a program and NASA scientists spent a decade and over $165 million developing a pen that writes in zero gravity, upside down, on almost any surface and at temperatures ranging from below freezing to over 300 C. The Russians used a pencil.” U.S. astronauts and Russian cosmonauts used pencils on their first space missions, according to NASA. From the late 1960s onward, they used Fisher Space Pens with pressurized ink cartridges that worked in zero gravity and at extreme temperatures. The Fisher Space Pens were not, however, developed by NASA engineers but rather Paul Fisher of the now-dubbed Fisher Space Pen Company with a reported $1 million investment. None of the funding for the research and development of the pens came from NASA, according to NASA history web curator Steve Garber. Both U.S. and Russian astronauts continue to these pens in space flights, according to NASA.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/TrumpRulesUSA/photos/a.405624119832911/876044042790914/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/TrumpRulesUSA/photos/a.405624119832911/876044042790914/?type=3&theater,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-nasa-spen/,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/08/18/fact-check-us-most-military-satellites-space/,https://history.nasa.gov/spacepen.html,https://history.nasa.gov/spacepen.html,https://history.nasa.gov/spacepen.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6e1a1c0b18011c2e0a0f0702170d0f02020b1c400d0103",Did NASA Spend More Than $165 Million To Develop Pens That Work In Space?,,,,,

Elise Stefanik giving the middle finger after former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch’s testimony to the House Intelligence Committee. Facebook/Screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The image of Stefanik was taken from news coverage of the impeachment hearings and doctored to show her giving the middle finger. Fact Check: Stefanik, a congresswoman from New York, is the only Republican woman on the House Intelligence Committee. She and other members of the committee questioned Yovanovitch during the second day of public hearings in the House’s impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump. The Facebook post features a screen grab of a tweet from George Conway, the husband of White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. He quote tweeted a viral picture allegedly depicting Stefanik making an obscene gesture to the camera following Yovanovitch’s testimony.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “This woman doesn’t deserve to hold public office,” tweeted Conway. “Please retweet this and give what you can to her opponent, @TedraCobb.” (RELATED: Did Four Republicans Vote To Impeach Trump?) The viral image has, however, been digitally manipulated. It seems to have come from a CNN video of the impeachment hearing that shows people applauding Yovanovitch as she leaves the room. Stefanik approaches the camera and then turns away, without making any obscene gesture, according to the video. Youtube/Screenshot Stefanik addressed the doctored photo on Twitter Nov. 16.

Proof from yesterday,” Stefanik tweeted, along with photo evidence that she wasn’t wearing nail polish that day.

Fact Check: Dianna Agron, an actress known for her role in popular television series “Glee,” tweeted the claim in 2014. The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 900 times, features a screen grab of her tweet. (RELATED: Is J.K. Rowling The First Person To Fall Off The Forbes Billionaires List For Charitable Giving?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “[Fun Fact]: In 1770, British parliament banned lipstick, saying it had the power to seduce men into marriage, which was classified as witchcraft,” reads the screen grab. However, neither the U.K. Parliament nor its precursor passed a law banning lipstick in 1770 or any other year. The Daily Caller found no record of any such legislation in JustisOne, an extensive legal database that contains British parliamentary acts dating back to 1707. A member of parliament (MP) introduced a bill against the “vice of painting” in June 1650 but it never received a full reading, according to U.K. National Archives spokeswoman Clare Kelly. It was “likely introduced at the behest of a Puritan MP but the Council of State chose not to pursue it,” per the U.K. National Archives. Furthermore, fears of witchcraft were no longer widespread in late 18th century Britain, making it unlikely that MPs would have pursued legislation on such issues.  “One of the areas of witches’ believed subversion was, indeed, male sexuality; and so such a claim had some credibility – a century and more earlier,” said Phillips Stevens Jr., an anthropology professor at the University of Buffalo, in an email to the Caller. “By 1770 the witch fears had pretty well subsided.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/Fangoddesses/photos/a.1396787787255995/2460242010910562/?type=3&theater,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1872698/,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1327801/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_11,https://twitter.com/diannaagron/status/423230504897224704?lang=en,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/29/fact-check-jk-rowling-first-forbes-billionaires-list-philanthropy-charitable-giving/,https://www.britannica.com/event/Act-of-Union-Great-Britain-1707,https://app.justis.com/search/lipstick/1/Relevance,https://www.british-history.ac.uk/commons-jrnl/vol6/pp420-422#h3-0004,http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/anthropology/faculty/faculty_directory.host.html/content/shared/cas/anthropology/Faculty-Staff/faculty-profiles/stevens-phillips.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01757364776e73416560686d7862606d6d64732f626e6c","No, British Parliament Didn’t Ban Lipstick In 1770 For Fear It Had ‘The Power To Seduce Men Into Marriage’",,,,,

However, there is no evidence that Reagan ever made the statement. A search for the quote in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library’s digital archive returned no matches. It does not appear in his presidential diaries, correspondence or autobiography. “Reagan often had a lighter touch with his enemies – he preferred the quip and the riposte to the slam and the slur – so it doesn’t really sound like him,” said Gil Troy, a history professor at McGill University, in an email to the Caller. “And he wasn’t the type to go so sweeping across so many generations.” Pelosi’s father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., served as mayor of Baltimore from 1947 to 1959, while her eldest brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, served a term as mayor from 1967 to 1971. Both were members of the Democratic party. (RELATED: Did Pelosi Campaign On ‘Draining The Swamp’?)

This viral meme, which has been shared more than 2,800 times, alleges that Clinton sent a profanity-laced email presumably about her 2016 political rival Donald Trump to Brazile Oct. 17, 2016.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “If that f**kin bastard wins, we’re all going to hang from nooses!” reads the purported email to Brazile. “You better fix this s**t!” WikiLeaks released thousands of emails from Clinton, her campaign manager John Podesta and the DNC during the 2016 election cycle. Yet, while the leaked emails provide access to her communications, there is no record of Clinton ever sending or receiving an email containing the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. An internet search revealed no credible media outlets linking the statement to Clinton either. (RELATED: Did Hillary Clinton Once Say She Wanted Trump To Run For Office?) The alleged statement, previously debunked by Snopes, may be a variation of a quote that appeared in a 2016 article on Victurus Libertas, a website described by The New York Times as a “conspiracy-minded news site that suggests, among other things, that the Titanic was deliberately sunk and that the queen of England is a reptilian alien.”  This particular article claims that Clinton lost her temper with NBC employees after participating in a 2016 presidential candidate forum hosted by Matt Lauer, an anchor for the network at the time. At one point, she allegedly yelled, “If I lose, we all go down and that Fascist F**k will have us swinging from nooses!” The article credits Politico as the source of the quote, though the statement appears nowhere in the cited article.

Fact Check: U.S. special forces operators executed a nighttime raid Oct. 26 that resulted in the death of al-Baghdadi. The Islamic State leader retreated to a tunnel beneath his northwestern Syrian compound and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and two children, according to The New York Times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The meme, which includes screen grabs from footage of Lemon and al-Baghdadi, uses the alleged quote to question Lemon’s intelligence. “‘Trump killed an unarmed father of three.’ – Don Lemon of CNN 10/27/2019,” reads the caption. “Yes, the idiot really said this on live television.” Other versions of the claim circulated on Facebook in the form of manipulated CNN chyrons that read “Trump killed an unarmed father of three.” (RELATED: Was Trump Golfing During The al-Baghdadi Raid?) There is, however, no evidence Lemon ever said the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of CNN transcripts, as well as the video clip editing service Grabien, turned up no matching or similar phrases. Contrary to the meme’s claim, “CNN Tonight” did not air on Oct. 27, the Sunday that Trump announced al-Baghdadi’s death. Lemon’s newscast only airs on weekdays, according to CNN’s programming schedule. A spokeswoman for CNN confirmed to FactCheck.org that Lemon was not on air that day.

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Foxworthy, an award-winning comedian, is known for his “You Might Be A Redneck” one-liners. The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 700 times, bears some resemblance to the format of these popular jokes. (RELATED: Did Jeff Foxworthy Write This Post Distinguishing Republicans From Democrats?) “If your government believes that the best way to eradicate trillions of dollars of debt is to spend trillions more – you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots,” reads one such statement. “If you cross the Cuban borden illegally you will be thrown into political prison to rot,” reads another. However, the Daily Caller found no evidence that Foxworthy ever wrote or said the statements attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his verified social media accounts yielded no results. No credible media outlets reported him making the statements either.  More than half of the statements appear to have originated with Edmunds’ Politically True 2013 blog post entitled “Channeling Jeff Foxworthy In A Country Founded By Geniuses And Run By Idiots,” though Edmunds noted some ideas came from an uncopyrighted email. The mention of Foxworthy in the title and the resemblance of the format to Foxworthy’s one-liners may have spurred the erroneous attribution to Foxworthy.

The video was posted on what appears to be a fake news website that has no apparent affiliation with BBC News. Fact Check: Johnson, known for roles like “Ballers” and “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,” isn’t the first celebrity to fall victim to a death hoax this year. In September, social media users speculated that actor Clint Eastwood had died from a heart attack while filming a commercial. (RELATED: Did Clint Eastwood Die From A Heart Attack Like This Facebook Post Claims?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This Facebook post links to a video masquerading as content from BBC News, with the headline reading, “ACTUAL FOOTAGE: Dwyne (sic) ‘The Rock’ Johnson Dies at 47 After a Terrible Stunt Attempt Failed.” It includes footage of “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts presumably reporting on the death of another celebrity. The video appears nowhere on the BBC News website nor on the network’s social media accounts. The website hosting the video has no apparent affiliation with BBC News and seems to be a fake news site. Contrary to the post’s claim, Johnson is very much alive. He has been active on his social media accounts since the post was shared on Nov. 13. For instance, Johnson wished “Jumanji: The Next Level” co-star Danny DeVito a “Happy Birthday” on Instagram Nov. 17. False rumors of Johnson having died previously circulated in 2011, 2014 and 2017, according to Snopes. “Rumors of my death are false,” he wrote on Facebook in 2011. “I’m still ‘Bringin’ It’ 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year – including leap year!”  Johnson’s cousin, Tanoai Reed, has been Johnson’s main stunt double for nearly 20 years, according to Men’s Health.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/ycnmaemae/posts/2860615380684050?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCCMADJO2lwbJIm4AGzyhL3Aw9QzsAsTzjJpMnWwtfOZecf6wXp8L30sVOKUM6gWnJ-bGXxxkL3tn1xBy5VpSg_TTNF_IQC0ne2ZAgK96cyDNFn9JlRYloC8Zzn6nWmFk9JFB74Z1ZOfKjvjvKHqcaCYUVivXxhTMVziGi_rkdsSs1wD0dHwHXpnD3lybm-O6_5mwjk6JXPLYTpkqz_PNt2BUtYMjVci8_Xj0A15z32acH3aqcMz03dcxW1OYXdkL2Rx8vaR0XCR5aWvzzkbsW9FxNwsj2Ep14QjV2Vv0wuRMUiEXbonyqrl0f5I9-A2IR45d9-LtGH3QLKgtpgALjswFRl&__tn__=-R,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2891574/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_10,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283362/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_16,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22clint%22%20AND%20%22eastwood%22%20AND%20%22dead%22%20until%3A2019-09-24%20since%3A2019-09-01&src=typed_query,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/25/fact-check-clint-eastwood-dead-heart-attack-facebook-post-fake/,https://wereblogs.com/#news/5746,https://www.bbc.co.uk/search?q=%22dwayne+johnson%22+AND+%22dead%22&sa_f=search-product&scope=,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22dwayne%20johnson%22%20AND%20%22dead%22%20(from%3ABBCWorld%20OR%20from%3ABBCNews%20OR%20from%3ABBCBreaking%20OR%20from%3ABBCNewsnight)&src=typed_query,https://wereblogs.com/#news/5746,https://www.facebook.com/DwayneJohnson/,https://twitter.com/TheRock,https://www.instagram.com/p/B4_C7Q4l4CH/,https://www.instagram.com/p/B4_C7Q4l4CH/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dwayne-johnson-death-hoax/,https://www.facebook.com/DwayneJohnson/posts/10150232791584384,https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a22595069/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-stuntman-tanoai-reed/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#33474156455c417357525a5f4a50525f5f56411d505c5e",Did Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson Die In A Stunt Accident Like This Facebook Post Claims?,,,,,

Verdict: False Trump did make a comment about Ancient Rome in an appearance with Mattarella, but he never said that the U.S.-Italy alliance dates back to that time period. Mattarella’s interpreter was not visibly present when Trump made his remark about Ancient Rome. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Trump met with the Italian president to discuss trade and several other topics on Oct. 16. They spoke to the press at three public events – before their bilateral meeting, during a joint press conference and at a reception. Mattarella’s interpreter, some noted, appeared to react on camera to a few of Trump’s statements. This Facebook post alleges that the interpreter, identified as Elisabetta Savigni-Ullmann in media reports, visibly reacted to Trump saying the U.S. and Italy “have been allies since Ancient Rome.” Contrary to what the Facebook post claims, Trump never said the U.S.-Italy alliance dates back to that time period. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show Trump’s Parents Wearing KKK Robes) A search of transcripts from all three events show that Trump only said the words “Ancient Rome” one time, and that instance occurred during his joint press conference with Mattarella.  “The United States and Italy are bound together by a shared cultural and political heritage dating back thousands of years to Ancient Rome,” Trump actually said. “Over the centuries, the Italian people have blessed our civilization with magnificent works of art, science, philosophy, architecture, and music.” Further adding to the post’s dubiousness, video shows no interpreter visibly present behind the two presidents during the joint press conference. Mattarella presumably received translations of Trump’s statements through the headphones he was wearing at the time.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Savigni-Ullmann could only be seen sitting behind the two presidents in footage of their remarks before their bilateral meeting. The screenshots of her supposed reactions appear to come from broadcasts of that brief meeting with the press before their closed-door talks.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Darden Restaurants employees and their family members have made individual contributions to a leadership PAC, candidates and party committees. Fact Check: The hashtag #BoycottOliveGarden trended nationally on Twitter late August after a list of food companies supposedly financing Trump’s re-election campaign went viral. Olive Garden, an Italian-themed restaurant chain, appeared on that list.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Some tweets focused solely on Olive Garden allegedly making campaign donations to Trump. Similar claims also appeared on Facebook. (RELATED: Was Jane Fonda Denied Service At A Restaurant Run By A Vietnam Veteran?) “Olive Garden is funding Trump’s re-election in 2020,” reads one such post. “It would be terrible if you shared this and Olive Garden lost business.” The restaurant chain took to Twitter Aug. 26 to dispel the rumor.  We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates. — Olive Garden (@olivegarden) August 26, 2019   “We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates,” reads the tweet. Olive Garden also said in a tweet its parent company, Darden Restaurants, does not donate to “any federal or presidential candidates.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  OpenSecrets.org, a campaign finance database operated by the Center for Responsive Politics, shows that Darden Restaurants has not donated to Trump’s re-election campaign. In fact, it hasn’t made any donations through its PAC or otherwise this election cycle, according to the database. Corporations are prohibited from donating to candidates and party committees, according to the Federal Election Commission. OpenSecrets.org has a similar disclaimer on its profile page for Darden Restaurants. Corporations can, however, make contributions through company-affiliated PACs, but OpenSecrets.org shows all donations associated with Darden Restaurants came from individuals. Darden Restaurants owners, employees or their immediate family members – not the company itself – have contributed a total of $17,332 so far during the 2020 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org. Of that figure, $11,899 went to candidates (all Democrats), $5,000 went to a Democratic leadership PAC and $433 went to party committees. Candidates that received donations include South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Peter Buttigieg and Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Trump has not received any campaign contributions from Darden Restaurants-affiliated individuals so far, according to the database. Other media outlets and fact-checkers have previously debunked this claim.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It actually comes from a 2011 communication campaign featuring photoshopped images of various world leaders kissing. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Obama and Chavez interacted a number of times in their capacities as the leaders of their respective nations. The Facebook post, shared more than 12,000 times, allegedly depicts Obama sharing a kiss with the late Venezuelan president. However, a quick reverse image search revealed that the image has been digitally manipulated. Italian fashion company Benetton’s UNHATE Foundation created the photoshopped picture for its 2011 “Unhate” communication campaign to promote “reconciliation and tolerance,” according to CNBC. Other campaign images showed German Chancellor Angela Merkel kissing former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Pope Benedict XVI kissing Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb. The ad featuring the pope was later withdrawn after the Vatican took legal action against Benetton, according to Reuters. The White House expressed disapproval of the campaign, which also included a photoshopped image of Obama lip-locked with former Chinese President Hu Jintao, in November 2011. (RELATED: Did Obama Award The Presidential Medal Of Freedom To Clinton, Cosby, Weiner And Weinstein?)  “The White House has a longstanding policy disapproving of the use of the president’s name and likeness for commercial purposes,” said then-White House spokesman Eric Schultz, according to Reuters. Though the UNHATE Foundation disclaimed that the pictures were “symbolic images” in a press release, the image shared on Facebook fails to do the same. It deceptively portrays the image of Obama kissing Chavez as real.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Obama has been the subject of manipulated pictures in the past. In July, the former president appeared in a doctored image on Facebook that depicted him awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former President Bill Clinton, comedian Bill Cosby, movie producer Harvey Weinstein and former congressman Anthony Weiner.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False A transit police officer handcuffed and detained the man, identified by news reports as Steve Foster, for refusing to provide the identification necessary to issue a citation, according to a BART spokeswoman. Foster was neither arrested nor booked. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Mail shared a video, originally posted by Foster, with the headline “Cop arrests black male for eating a sandwich on a BART platform.” The video shows a confrontation between Foster and a BART transit officer, identified as D. McCormick, after the officer saw Foster eating a sandwich on a BART platform near Concord, California. It went viral over the weekend. Foster was briefly detained and later received a citation for eating on the platform, according to a statement from BART General Manager Bob Powers. He admitted to cursing at and making homophobic slurs to the officer, reports ABC 7. Numerous online media outlets, including NowThis and We The People, shared videos of the incident online with similar claims. However, a BART spokeswoman told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that Foster was “lawfully handcuffed for repeatedly refusing to provide his identification,” not for eating his sandwich. Identification is required for a transit officer to give a citation and, according to the BART spokeswoman, failure to comply with a citation can result in detention.  “In this case, the officer observed an infraction and proceeded to attempt to issue a citation,” said Rabin Nabizadeh, an attorney at the California-based Summit Defense law firm, in an email to the DCNF. “Once the individual refused to provide his identification, the officer was within his rights to detain the individual and even formally arrest him for a violation of the far more serious Misdemeanor.” “Once he provided his identification he was given the citation for violation of the penal code (eating in the paid area) and released,” said Alicia Trost, the chief communications officer for BART, in an email. “He was not arrested or booked.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Both state law and BART policy prohibits the consumption of food and drink in the “Paid Area” of stations, which former BART Police Chief Gary Gee defined in a statement as “the places where you need a ticket such as inside the fare gates of a station, on platforms or on any train.” Violators face up to a $250 fine and up to 48 hours of community service, according to the state statute. Transit officers typically have no need to write citations as commuters usually stop eating when asked, according to Trost. The transit officer in the video proceeded to cite Foster after the man refused to stop eating his sandwich. Powers later issued an apology to “Mr. Foster, our riders, employees, and the public who have had an emotional reaction to the video.” BART’s independent police auditor is currently investigating the incident. Foster has said that he is considering taking legal action against the transit agency, according to ABC 7. Foster did not return the DCNF’s request for comment.

There is no evidence that Omar ever made the statement, though she has been critical of some of President Donald Trump’s policies in the past. Fact Check: Omar has become a popular target for fake quotes since her election to the House of Representatives in 2018. This meme, which has been widely shared on Facebook, alleges that the freshman congresswoman criticized Trump for “taking benefits away from black Americans by giving them jobs.” “You may think a low unemployment rate is good, but it’s just part of Trump’s evil racist plan to make sure blacks are no longer wards of the state,” the caption reads. “It’s horribly racist to make them work.” (RELATED: Did Ilhan Omar Say That ‘All White Men Should Be Put In Chains’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, there is no evidence of Omar saying the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller searched the web and her verified social media accounts and could not find any proof that Omar ever made the statement. It doesn’t appear in ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets either. The quote seems to have originated with a fake news article on the website Genesius Times entitled “Omar: ‘Trump is taking benefits from blacks by giving them jobs.'” The article, published in July, also includes a fabricated quote from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Though the website has a clear disclaimer noting that it’s a fake news website, the image shared on Facebook fails to issue a similar warning. It deceptively portrays the quote as real. The website’s tagline describes itself as the “most reliable source of fake news on the planet.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  The internet is replete with sayings ascribed to Einstein, both genuine and apocryphal. The quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appears to fall in the latter category. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say, ‘Certain People Appear Bright Until You Hear Them Speak’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A search for the expression in the Einstein Archives Online, which contains around 80,000 documents related to the theoretical physicist, turned up no matches. It appears in the “Probably Not By Einstein” section of Alice Calaprice’s “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein,” a preeminent text on sayings from Einstein. The Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to several experts, none of whom could find the saying in his writings. “There’s no source for this one, and so it’s probably not by Einstein,” said Andrew Robinson, author of “Einstein: A Hundred Years of Relativity,” in an email to the DCNF. A precursor to the expression appeared in a late 19th century French encyclopedic dictionary, according to the website Quote Investigator. The work, entitled “Great Universal Dictionary of the Nineteenth Century” in English, includes a saying attributed to writer Alexandre Dumas fils under the entry “Stupidity.”  “One thing that humbles me deeply is to see that human genius has its limits while human stupidity does not,” it reads. Variations of the saying have been attributed to Einstein since at least 1994, according to Quote Investigator.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: Plato, born around 428 B.C., is widely considered a prominent figure in Western philosophy. Many of his works, like “Republic” and “Symposium,” are still cited today.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Yet, while Plato’s works remain eminently quotable, the statement attributed to him the Facebook post appears to be apocryphal. The DCNF searched Plato’s complete works for the expression but found nothing matching or similar. Two experts also confirmed in emails to the DNCF that the quote does not come from Plato, with Cornell University professor Charles Francis Brittain writing, “As quoted there’s no way that’s by Plato.” (RELATED: Did Plato Say, ‘Be Kind, Everyone You Meet Is Fighting A Hard Battle’?) “I have thoroughly studied all of the dialogues of Plato and he never wrote this,” Sara Ahbel-Rappe, a professor of Greek and Latin at the University of Michigan with expertise in Plato’s work, said in an email to the DCNF. “Nor had he expressed any interest in ‘discovering more about a person,’ as his interest was always in the truth of views, not in ad hominem queries,” Ahbel-Rappe continued. “He did not share our contemporary cult of personality and was not a strategist or politician.”  An early precursor to the expression appeared in Richard Lingard’s 1696 pamphlet entitled “A Letter of Advice to a Young Gentleman Leaving the University Concerning His Behaviour and Conversation in the World,” according to the website Quote Investigator. In the pamphlet, Lingard wrote, “If you would read a mans (sic) Disposition, see him Game, you will then learn more of him in one hour, than in seven Years Conversation.” Quote Investigator found other, more concise variations of the saying appearing after that early instance, with the first known attribution to Plato occurring in the 1950s.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He does not have a public Twitter account. Fact Check: Freeman, an award-winning actor with a career spanning more than 5 decades, is known for starring in such films as “Driving Miss Daisy” and “The Shawshank Redemption.” From 2010 to 2017, he also hosted the space documentary series “Through the Wormhole.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is, however, no record of him ever making the statement attributed to him in the screen grabbed tweet. Freeman does not have a verified Twitter account, and no similar statements appear on his official Facebook page. The Daily Caller found no interview or movie in which he said this either. An internet search revealed that the statement has been circulating online since at least 2015. It’s unclear how it first became linked to Freeman. (RELATED: Did Morgan Freeman Say He Hates The Word Homophobia?) The “holiday” proposed in the screen grabbed tweet resembles, to some extent, an annual World Wildlife Fund-led event called Earth Hour, in which participants around the world turn off their lights for one hour. The event, which has spread to more than 180 countries, calls for greater awareness and more sparing use of natural resources to help the environment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/anonews.co/photos/a.997588523586040/3119483471396524/?type=3&theater,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097239/,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111161/,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1513168/,https://www.facebook.com/MorganFreeman/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/2t31p3/we_should_have_a_holiday_called_space_day_where/,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/05/fact-check-morgan-freeman-homophobia/,https://www.worldwildlife.org/about,https://www.earthhour.org/what-is-earth-hour,https://apnews.com/f94140b8e19e4e18b31c1648c3370075,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4d393f283b223f0d292c2421342e2c2121283f632e2220",Did Morgan Freeman Propose A Holiday To Reduce Light Pollution On Twitter?,,,,,

Will Hurd of Texas, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Fred Upton of Michigan and Susan Brooks of Indiana voted to impeach President Donald Trump.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “WANTED OUT OF OFFICE … for obstructing progress,” reads the caption. Verdict: False To date, there has been no House vote to impeach Trump. Hurd, Upton, Brooks and Fitzpatrick have all expressed, to some extent, opposition to the impeachment inquiry. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });     Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in late September that the House would initiate an impeachment inquiry into Trump. The announcement came after a whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 15,000 times, alleges that four Republican members of Congress voted to impeach the president. “Will Hurd, Fred Upton, Susan Brooks and Brian Fitzpatrick,” reads the caption. “Remember these faces next election!”  There has, however, been no House vote to impeach the president to date, making it impossible for the four Republicans mentioned in the Facebook post to have voted in favor of such a motion. In fact, the House only just passed a resolution formalizing the procedures of the impeachment inquiry into Trump on Oct. 31. The resolution passed largely along party lines – 232-196 – with two Democrats voting against it. Hurd, Upton, Brooks and Fitzpatrick all voted against it, along with the rest of the House Republicans, according to Fox News. (RELATED: Did Vermont Gov. Phil Scott Vote To Impeach President Trump?)  Furthermore, the congresswoman and three congressmen have all expressed, to some extent, opposition to the impeachment inquiry. The New York Times lists all four of them in the “no or not now” column of its interactive “Who Supports an Impeachment Inquiry Against Trump?” list. Josh Paciorek, the communications director for Upton, told the Daily Caller in an email that the Michigan congressman does not support the impeachment inquiry.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Hurd’s communication director, Callie Strock, confirmed in an email that the claim in the Facebook post was “totally false.” Hurd has also voted in opposition to the impeachment inquiry when it has come up in previous legislation, according to Strock. A press release from Brooks’ office says that the Indiana congresswoman views the recent impeachment hearings as “partisan and unwarranted” and “doesn’t see anything criminal or impeachable in the summary of Trump’s conversation with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy (sic).” “The Congressman believes that Speaker Pelosi’s response, however, to move forward with impeachment proceedings is ill-advised,” Fitzpatrick’s office said in a statement to The New York Times. Fitzpatrick and Brooks’ offices did not return the Caller’s requests for comment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Roosevelt during his youth.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The image actually shows Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr., the fifth child of Franklin D. Roosevelt. Fact Check: Franklin D. Roosevelt served as president from 1933 until his death in 1945. He is widely recognized for his role in formulating the New Deal — a series of economic programs enacted during the Great Depression — and leading the U.S. through most of World War II. (RELATED: Ocasio-Cortez Says The Constitution Was Amended To Stop FDR’s Re-Election)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which dubiously describes Franklin D. Roosevelt as a “Democratic Socialist” and “the most popular President ever,” identifies the man in the seemingly colorized image as the former president. The caption says, “He was the exact kind of person that both the Democrats and Republicans are terrified of today.” A reverse image search revealed that the image has actually been miscaptioned and does not, in fact, show the nation’s 32nd president. The young man pictured is his son, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. The Daily Progress, a Virginia newspaper, includes the image in an article describing Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr.’s visit to the University of Virginia law school in February 1937. It’s unclear, however, if a photographer for The Daily Progress took the picture during that visit or used an already-circulating picture of the younger Roosevelt. Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. went on to have a political career of his own, serving as a New York congressman from 1949 to 1955 and as President John F. Kennedy’s undersecretary of commerce. He also became the first chairman of the Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission under then-President Lyndon Johnson.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2336083010039703&set=a.1491239914524021&type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/event/New-Deal,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/04/02/fact-check-ocasio-cortez-22-amendment-fdr-election/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2336083010039703&set=a.1491239914524021&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2336083010039703&set=a.1491239914524021&type=3&theater,http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=r000425,https://www.dailyprogress.com/125yearsofprogress/fdr-jr-visits-uva-law-school-on-this-day-in/article_5ae4a19a-f6a5-11e6-90e8-8fe6779c9f31.html,http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=r000425,https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-08-17-mn-651-story.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f0b0d1a09100d3f1b1e1613061c1e13131a0d511c1012",Does This Image Show Young Franklin D.

Comedian John Fugelsang claimed credit for the quote in 2013. Fact Check: Carter served as president from 1977 to 1981 and later established himself as an international humanitarian. In 1982, he and his wife Rosalynn cofounded the Carter Center, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting human rights around the globe.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While Carter has often spoken and written about the subject of Christianity, there is no evidence that he originated the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post.

An internet search also revealed no credible sources linking the statement to Carter. (RELATED: Did Patrick Henry Say The US Was Founded On Christianity?) The quote, debunked by Snopes in 2014, appears to have originated with Fugelsang, a comedian and television personality. He uttered the statement during a May 2013 segment called “Revoltingly Fake Christian of the Week” on the Current TV’s “Viewpoint” program. (The show is no longer available online.) In September 2013, Fugelsang clarified via Twitter that he was the actual source of the quotation. “This quote was widely attributed to Jimmy Carter,” Fugelsang tweeted. “I apologize to him for it.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/MiddleAmericanDemocrat/photos/a.336020010101140/980576675645467/?type=3&theater,https://www.pbs.org/wnet/dream-on/press/first-degree-john-fugelsang/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jimmy-Carter/Life-after-the-presidency,https://www.cartercenter.org/about/index.html,https://www.cartercenter.org/news/publications/carter_books/index.html,https://www.cartercenter.org/search-results.html?cx=002103672340969920600%3A_vijclldgmc&q=%22If+you+don%27t+want+your+tax+dollars+to+help+the+poor+-+then+stop+saying+you+want+a+country+based+on+Christian+values%2C+because+you+don%27t%22&ie=UTF-8&submit=+#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=%22If%20you%20don't%20want%20your%20tax%20dollars%20to%20help%20the%20poor%20-%20then%20stop%20saying%20you%20want%20a%20country%20based%20on%20Christian%20values%2C%20because%20you%20don't%22&gsc.page=1,https://www.cartercenter.org/news/editorials_speeches/speeches-archives.html,https://www.jimmycarterlibrary.gov/search#q=%22If%20you%20don't%20want%20your%20tax%20dollars%20to%20help%20the%20poor%20-%20then%20stop%20saying%20you%20want%20a%20country%20based%20on%20Christian%20values%2C%20because%20you%20don't%22&t=Digital_Library&sort=relevancy,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/28/fact-check-patrick-henry-nation-founded-religionists-christians-jesus-christ/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jimmy-carter-helping-poor/,https://current.com/ctv_traffic,https://twitter.com/johnfugelsang/status/378267953625853952?lang=en,https://twitter.com/johnfugelsang/status/378267953625853952?lang=en,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dda9afb8abb2af9db9bcb4b1a4bebcb1b1b8aff3beb2b0","Did Jimmy Carter Say, ‘If You Don’t Want Your Tax Dollars To Help The Poor – Then Stop Saying You Want A Country Based On Christian Values, Because You Don’t’?",,,,,

The United States of America should have a foundation free from the influence of clergy.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Washington authored the statement. The first sentence comes from a version of the Treaty of Tripoli; the second may actually be a variation of a line from a biography of Albert Gallatin, the treasury secretary from 1801 to 1814. Fact Check: Washington, a founding father and the nation’s first president, is frequently ascribed sayings on governance and religion. (RELATED: Did George Washington Say This Quote About The ‘Willingness With Which Our Young People Are Likely To Serve In Any War’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, there is no evidence that Washington ever said or wrote the expression attributed to him in the Facebook post. It appears nowhere in the Papers of George Washington or his recorded speeches. A quick internet search revealed that the first line actually comes from the English-language version of the Treaty of Tripoli. The treaty, which was ratified in 1797, sought to protect American ships from Barbary pirates. Katie Blizzard of the Washington Papers at the University of Virginia confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that the second sentence of the alleged quote does not appear in Washington’s writings but was unable to provide “any definite information” on its origin. “There does not appear to be any basis for Washington authoring the quote after which you are inquiring,” Blizzard told the Caller in an email. “Though Washington respected religious diversity, he also believed religion to be important to the preservation of democracy.”  The second sentence is often attributed to Gallatin, a former treasury secretary, yet it does not appear in the “Writings of Albert Gallatin,” according to Blizzard. It may actually be a variation of a line from John Austin Stevens’ 1883 biography of Gallatin that readers then mistakenly ascribed to Gallatin. In the biography, Stevens offered an interpretation of what he perceived to be Gallatin’s beliefs, writing, “Private zeal could alone be relied upon to establish the new enterprise on a foundation free from the influence of clergy; an indispensable condition of success. These were the views of Mr. Jefferson in 1807. These were the views of Mr. Gallatin.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Donald Trump caught GOLFING during U.S. military raid against Baghdadi and ISIS https://t.co/l84ITxRl1T — Palmer Report (@PalmerReport) October 27, 2019    googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Donald Trump caught GOLFING during U.S. military raid against Baghdadi and ISIS,” reads the headline. Verdict: False  The president was not golfing, but rather present in the Situation Room at the time of the raid, according to a widely reported timeline of events. White House press pool reports also place him at the White House. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Delta Force commandos executed a nighttime raid in northwestern Syria on Oct. 26 that resulted in the death of al-Baghdadi. The ISIS leader retreated to a tunnel beneath his compound and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and three of his children. No Americans were killed in the operation. Trump announced the result of the mission in a press conference the following day. “Last night, the United States brought the world’s number one terrorist leader to justice,” said the president. “Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead.” During a question-and-answer session with reporters at the press conference, Trump said he watched the raid from the Situation Room at the White House, noting it was “as though you were watching a movie.”  Some, including Palmer Report and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, alleged that the president was playing golf at the time that the raid occurred. But, according to the timeline of events reported by numerous media outlets, this claim is untrue. The Washington Post, The New York Times, and Reuters all place Trump at the White House at the time of the raid. So do White House pool reports. (RELATED: Has ‘70%’ Of ISIS Territory In Iraq Been Liberated?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Trump did play a round of golf from approximately 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at a Trump Organization golf course in Virginia, but he returned to the White House shortly before 4:30 p.m., according to pool reports and media coverage. The Washington Post and Reuters reported that Trump was present in the Situation Room around 5 p.m., when the raid approximately began. Indeed, a photograph released by the White House shows Trump and military advisors in the Situation Room, appearing to watch the raid unfold. Metadata from the picture dates it to 5:06 p.m., according to The Washington Post. Helicopters carrying U.S. special forces operators departed from a military base in Iraq at roughly the same time — 5 p.m. EDT — and arrived at the al-Baghdadi compound around 6:10 p.m., according to several media outlets. By 7:15 p.m., al-Baghdadi’s remains had been recovered, and he was confirmed dead. The operation lasted approximately two hours, according to Reuters. A tweet from Pete Souza, the former chief White House photographer under former President Barack Obama who took the now-famous bin Laden raid photograph, suggested the mission had taken place at 3:30 p.m., citing inaccurate early reports. That tweet, which garnered more than 38,000 likes, appears to have spurred the incorrect claim that Trump was playing golf at the time. Souza later corrected his alleged timeline of events, but did not delete his original tweet containing the erroneous information. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

His estate at Monticello considers it to be a “spurious quotation.” Fact Check: The internet is replete with quotes erroneously ascribed to the founding fathers, including Jefferson. (RELATED: Did John Adams Say, ‘There Are Two Ways To Conquer And Enslave A Nation. One Is By Sword. The Other Is By Debt’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In fact, sayings are misattributed to Jefferson so often that his estate at Monticello keeps a list of “spurious quotations.” A quick internet search reveals that this specific quote appears on that list. “People will see a quote and it appeals to an opinion that they have and if it has Jefferson’s name attached to it that gives it more weight,” Anna Berkes, a research librarian at Monticello, told The Wall Street Journal. “He’s constantly being invoked by people when they are making arguments about politics and actually all sorts of topics.” There is, however, no evidence that Jefferson ever said or wrote the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller found no instances of matching or similar phrases in his writings. A possible source of the quotation may be British philosopher John Stuart Hill’s 1867 address at the University of St. Andrews, according to Berkes. In his address, he said, “Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The claim likely stems from a satirical article published by The New Yorker in late September. Fact Check: The Facebook post, which is accompanied by a stylized portrait of the former president, alleges that Obama has signed a $90 million deal with Netflix to produce a series “about Trump’s impeachment.” (RELATED: Do Only 25% Of Americans Support Impeachment, As Trump Claims?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Obama said that casting for the roles of Trump and Mike Pence had already begun,” reads part of the caption. While Obama and his wife Michelle did sign a multi-year deal with Netflix to produce content for the online streaming service in 2018, there is no evidence that they will make a series on impeachment. In fact, their production company, Higher Ground Productions, unveiled in April a slate of seven projects that will be released over the next several years. That line-up does not include any series about impeachment. Furthermore, a spokesperson for Netflix confirmed to The Associated Press that the alleged deal in the Facebook post has not been made, nor is it under consideration. A spokeswoman for Obama also confirmed that the post’s claim is untrue, according to The Associated Press. The claim likely stems from a satirical article entitled “Obama to Produce Netflix Series About Trump’s Impeachment,” published by The New Yorker on Sept. 27. The article, written by Andy Borowitz and clearly labeled as satire, came just three days after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the initiation of a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. To date, there has been no House vote to impeach the president.  A quick internet search also revealed that the text of the Facebook post matches Borowitz’s article nearly word-for-word.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/watchingnext/photos/a.369510440214083/684545442043913/?type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/16/fact-check-president-donald-trump-poll-25-percent-support-impeachment/,https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/barack-michelle-obama-netflix-deal-1202817723/,https://apnews.com/f40010a4c1d2431b82fce2ea2a9b5843,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/business/media/obama-netflix-shows.html,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8046280188,https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8046280188,https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/obama-to-produce-netflix-series-about-trumps-impeachment,https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/obama-to-produce-netflix-series-about-trumps-impeachment,https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/92419-0,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3b4f495e4d54497b5f5a525742585a57575e4915585456",Did Barack Obama Sign A $90 Million Deal With Netflix To Produce A Series ‘About Trump’s Impeachment’?,,,,,

It likely got attributed to Murray after a Twitter account with the same name tweeted the quote in 2013, even though the account disclaims in its bio that it is not Murray’s official Twitter, but rather a parody account. (Murray doesn’t have a Twitter account, according to The New Yorker.) “I AM NOT BILL MURRAY,” reads the account’s bio. “This is a parody account. This account is not in any way affiliated with the actor Bill Murray.” The exact origin of the expression is unknown, but variations have appeared in print since at least 1987, according to etymologist Barry Popik.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/GeekLord/posts/10157766872091660,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000195/awards?ref_=nm_awd,https://www.amazon.com/Ghostbusters-Bill-Murray/dp/B000PEX1IE,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00170I7GG,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/20/fact-check-groucho-marx-politics-trouble-remedies/,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/02/13/bill_murray_comedy_harder_and_harder_to_do_because_people_trying_to_win_their_point_of_view.html,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/feb/13/bill-murray-praises-gop-tax-reform-its-fantastic-t/,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/20/gospel-bill-murray-new-film-st-vincent-interview,https://twitter.com/biiimurray/status/391336771692552192?lang=en,https://twitter.com/BiIIMurray?lang=en,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/bill-murray-internet-jester,https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/if_we_lie_to_congress_its_a_felony_and_if_congress_lies_to_us_its_just_poli,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#deaaacbba8b1ac9ebabfb7b2a7bdbfb2b2bbacf0bdb1b3","Did Bill Murray Say, ‘So, If We Lie To The Government, It’s A Felony.

Fact Check:  Hemingway, the author of the classics “A Farewell to Arms” and “The Old Man and the Sea,” is frequently credited with fake quotes. The saying attributed to him in the Facebook post appears to be one of them.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Searching for the expression in collections of Hemingway’s novels, poems and short stories turned up no matches. (RELATED: Did Ernest Hemingway Say, ‘I Love Sleep. My Life Has The Tendency To Fall Apart When I’m Awake’?) The DCNF also reached out to several experts, none of whom recognized the quotation as belonging to Hemingway. “It doesn’t sound like him,” said Mary Dearborn, author of “Ernest Hemingway: A Biography,” in an email to the DCNF. “He did write that great passage in ‘A Farewell to Arms’ about being ‘strong at the broken places,’ and I think all this contemporary talk about ‘broken’ families, abuse victims, systems is mistakenly attributed to him.” Indeed, Hemingway did write in his 1929 novel, “The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially.”  The quote from “A Farewell to Arms” might have evolved and “merged” with a lyric from singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen’s song “Anthem” to make the saying attributed to Hemingway in the Facebook post, according to the website Quote Investigator. The line in Cohen’s song reads, “There is a crack, a crack in everything/That’s how the light gets in.” “Its exact genesis is uncertain, but [Quote Investigator] hypothesizes that the 1929 statement by Hemingway and the 1992 lyric by Leonard Cohen both strongly influenced the evolution of the expression and its ascription,” writes Quote Investigator.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The alleged quote has been attributed to Hemingway since at least 2013, according to Quote Investigator.

Fact Check:  Dryden was a 17th-century English poet, playwright and literary critic. He wrote nearly 30 comedies, tragedies and dramatic operas and, in 1668, was appointed England’s first poet laureate.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched a collection of Dryden’s complete works but found no evidence he ever said or wrote the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. (RELATED: Did Sinclair Lewis Say, ‘When Fascism Comes To America, It Will Be Wrapped In The Flag And Carrying A Cross’?) “I certainly don’t recognize that anywhere among Dryden’s verse lines, nor is it like any of his (rare) prose bon mots,” said David Haley, a University of Minnesota English professor with expertise in Dryden’s work, in an email to the DCNF. “Whoever attributed this trite antithesis — it’s actually a chiasmus — to Dryden must have been thinking of some 18th-century moralist or a subsequent politician.” The website Quote Investigator found the earliest strong match for the quote in an 1888 book by religious writer Frederick Langbridge, in which he wrote, “We are our own potters; for our habits make us, and we made our habits.” However, elements of the expression appeared before this instance, according to Quote Investigator. Another early instance can be found in theologian Tryon Edwards’s 1891 compilation of quotes. It appears, unattributed, directly above another quote ascribed to Dryden, and it’s possible that readers mistakenly linked the alleged saying to Dryden due to its proximity to the other quotation, according to Quote Investigator.  While there is no evidence that Dryden authored the saying attributed to him in the Facebook post, he did write a line about habits in his translation of Ovid’s “Metamorphoses” that reads, “Ill Habits gather by unseen degrees, As Brooks make Rivers, Rivers run to Seas.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Most of the words in the post actually come from a Breitbart interview with actor Jon Voight. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Selleck, star of the popular 80s television series “Magnum, P.I.,” has expressed his political views in the past, telling National Review in 2004 that he was a “registered independent with a lot of libertarian leanings.” During the 2008 election cycle, he publicly endorsed Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain’s presidential bid. (RELATED: Did Steve Harvey Author This Pro-Trump Statement?) The Facebook post, which has been circulating since at least 2018, alleges that Selleck “praised” Trump as the “answer to our problems” and as “funny, playful, and colorful” in a “meeting” with Breitbart. The post also includes a number of other quotes attributed to Selleck and is paired with a picture of him. There is, however, no evidence that Selleck ever said these pro-Trump statements in a “meeting” with Breitbart. A search of Breitbart’s website revealed no interviews with Selleck saying words attributed to him in the Facebook post. In fact, most of the post was actually taken from an exclusive interview that Voight did with the outlet in March 2016. Further adding to the Facebook post’s dubiousness, Selleck told the hosts of “The View” that he wrote in the name of former Dallas Police Chief David Brown for president in 2016 because he “didn’t really support either candidate,” referring to Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/rick.t.valentine/posts/2818485571496028,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000685/,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080240/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_40,https://www.nationalreview.com/2004/05/ike-john-j-miller/,https://people.com/celebrity/jack-nicholson-backs-hillary-scarlett-sings-for-obama/,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/09/fact-check-did-steve-harvey-author-this-pro-trump-statement/,https://archive.fo/wj3EU,https://www.facebook.com/rick.t.valentine/posts/2818485571496028,https://www.breitbart.com/search/?s=%22tom+selleck%22+AND+%22funny%2C+playful%2C+and+colorful%22#gsc.tab=0&gsc.q=%22tom%20selleck%22%20AND%20%22funny%2C%20playful%2C%20and%20colorful%22&gsc.page=1,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2016/03/09/jon-voight-donald-trump/,https://www.facebook.com/TheView/videos/tom-selleck-discusses-presidential-election-the-view/10153942473536524/,https://www-m.cnn.com/2016/11/10/entertainment/tom-selleck-write-in-vote-dallas-police-chief/index.html?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#64101601120b162400050d081d0705080801164a070b09",Was Trump ‘Praised’ By Tom Selleck In A ‘Meeting’ With Breitbart?,,,,,

It was at that event more than two years ago that the picture depicting demonstrators holding the banner was taken. Contrary to what the Facebook post claims, the banner did not encourage violence against Republicans. A reverse image search revealed that the image has, in fact, been digitally altered to make the banner read, “Assassinate Republicans that beat Democrats.” It has also been cropped. The original image, found on the local Fox affiliate’s website, shows several demonstrators holding a banner that actually says, “Trump makes America hate, our students make America great.” Student protestors carried the banner as they marched to the arena where the rally was set to be held, according to the caption shared on the Fox 32 News Twitter account.

(RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say That Big Government Could ‘Take Everything You Have’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There is, however, no evidence that Jefferson authored the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson did not yield any similar or matching phrases; neither did a search of his collected letters and quotes. Furthermore, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which maintains his estate at Monticello, categorizes it as a spurious quotation. The source of the expression may actually be a series of debates on socialism published in 1914, according to the Monticello website. (The wording varies slightly in this instance.) “This quotation is vaguely similar to Jefferson’s comment in an 1825 letter to William Short,” notes the Monticello website. In Jefferson’s letter to Short, Jefferson wrote of the political parties of the time, “The latter fear the people, and wish to transfer all power to the higher classes of society; the former consider the people as the safest depository of power in the last resort; they cherish them therefore, and wish to leave in them all the powers to the exercise of which they are competent.”  The misattributed quote has been linked to Jefferson since at least 1994, according to etymologist Barry Popik.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Michelle Obama, the wife of former President Barack Obama, has become a frequent target for misinformation online. This quote, shared nearly 600 times on Facebook, is one such example. (RELATED: Does This Image Show Michelle Obama Texting During The Pledge Of Allegiance?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller found no evidence of the former first lady ever saying or writing the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. In fact, an internet search revealed that credible online sources have only reported on the statement in order to debunk it. The alleged quote, debunked by Snopes in 2015, may come from the headline of a post published by JewsNews.com. The post, titled “Michelle Obama says ‘White Folks’ are what’s Wrong with America,” discusses the commencement address that Michelle Obama gave at Tuskegee University in 2015. It’s possible that some readers interpreted the entire headline, not just the two words in quotation marks, as a direct quote from the former first lady. Her remarks did include a discussion of race and racism, but the transcript and video of the speech show that Michelle Obama only used the words “white folks” once. While she was talking about the experiences of the Tuskegee Airmen, she said, “They went on to show the world that if black folks and white folks could fight together, and fly together, then surely – surely – they could eat at a lunch counter together.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The Daily Caller also searched his books, “The Road Ahead” and “Business @ The Speed of Thought,” as well as his personal blog, but found no similar statements. In 1947, automobile executive Clarence Bleicher testified before the Senate that one should “put a lazy man on it” to make a difficult job easier. Bleicher’s testimony may have been abbreviated over the years into the statement falsely attributed to Gates, according to the website Quote Investigator. However, thematically-related sayings have appeared in print since at least 1920, according to the website Quote Investigator.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/WFactsDaily/posts/554608411957136?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARD3eM2IEPyOSlszQIlln8UlAD8V4ODJUYQBSW0ZyybVQPsmTpUCUfpVFZbL-W8FAl0Z07Hj1a_aaLTLTSnE85tYrlPo89YHBxtnT1yaYmO0XYKnacjA5bfPb177qyKVN-5kWLW3Mw3Tj6EwVFJ6sr9oJl7fPVW03PZIvp47ENxfNQy3wOwvYmIFCcG3TNmj-R18ubEN5skkMrLabVcv8aNgAsxEC4FkpSOyDxr0nlepRc6AbfL5WMWitXb2y5_jMd2lhUSx6w0o_D8NnpBAs1MwJUvN3LxOlyLey17MRBnT71v-nDEqfpByIA6-h0oANhMmBvFpEvbs_OMBnV8&__tn__=-R,https://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/#54fdf630689f,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Allen,https://twitter.com/melindagates?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor,https://www.gatesfoundation.org/who-we-are,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/29/fact-check-jk-rowling-first-forbes-billionaires-list-philanthropy-charitable-giving/,https://books.google.com/books?newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&id=tc-Hc-lUsD8C&dq=bill+the+road&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22lazy%22,https://books.google.com/books?id=Sx50blsZuMoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Business+at++the+Speed+of+Thought&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi9yuvR37DlAhUmxVkKHWo3CScQ6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22choose%20a%20lazy%20person%22&f=false,https://www.gatesnotes.com/search?search=%22i%20choose%20a%20lazy%22,https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.35112104266178&view=plaintext&seq=328,http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/02/26/lazy-job/,http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/02/26/lazy-job/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#11656374677e63517570787d6872707d7d74633f727e7c","Did Bill Gates Say, ‘I Choose A Lazy Person To Do A Hard Job’?",,,,,

Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A 19th-century American author, Melville wrote, along with numerous other stories and poems, the sea adventure novel “Moby-Dick.” (RELATED: Did Lewis Carroll Say, ‘Everyone Wants A Magical Solution To Their Problems, And Everyone Refuses To Believe In Magic’?) However, nowhere in that book, or in any of his other works, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of his complete works turned up no matching or similar expressions. Scott Norsworthy, the bibliographical associate on “The Writings Of Herman Melville,” debunked the saying in a 2011 blog post titled, “the finest thing Herman Melville never said.” The expression actually originates with Melvill, an Anglican preacher of no relation to Melville, according to Norsworthy. In an 1855 sermon, Melvill said, “Ye live not for yourselves; ye cannot live for yourselves; a thousand fibres connect you with your fellow-men, and along those fibres, as along sympathetic threads, run your actions as causes, and return to you as effects.”  “It’s a simple case of mistaken identity,” wrote Norsworthy. Several Melville experts, including Columbia University professor Andrew Delbanco and Hofstra University professor John Bryant, directed the DCNF to Norsworthy’s blog when asked about the erroneously attributed quote.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Verdict: False The picture has been miscaptioned. It actually shows American soldiers in Kuwait in December 2011. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been circulating since Oct. 17, claims to show three U.S. soldiers in Syria “crying and visibly shaken” in reaction to Trump’s announcement. “U.S. soldiers on the ground in Syria seen crying and visibly shaken saying they could stop this in 10 minutes but Trump won’t let them!” reads the caption. Trump announced the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria in early October, ahead of a Turkish military incursion into the area. The withdrawal, some have noted, largely abandoned the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces who were allied with the U.S. in combating the Islamic State. Through a reverse image search, the Daily Caller found that the photograph does not, in fact, show soldiers in Syria reacting to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northeastern Syria. The image, taken by Lucas Jackson for Reuters, actually shows troops at Camp Virginia, Kuwait, in 2011, according to the caption.

Fact Check:  Lewis, a Nobel Prize-winning author, wrote dozens of novels over the course of his career, including “Babbitt” and “Main Street,” as well as numerous short stories, plays and poems.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched Yale University’s digital archive of Lewis’ writings but found no matches for the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. “This quote sounds like something Sinclair Lewis might have said or written, but we’ve never been able to find this exact quote,” said Sally Parry, the executive director of the Sinclair Lewis Society, in an email to the DCNF. According to Parry, the statement is similar to a line found in Lewis’ 1935 novel “It Can’t Happen Here,” in which the U.S. government falls under the rule of a fascist dictatorship. The expression does not appear in the book but, as Parry points out, it is thematically similar to the following line: “But he saw too that in America the struggle was befogged by the fact that the worst Fascists were they who disowned the word ‘Fascism’ and preached enslavement to Capitalism under the style of Constitutional and Traditional Native American Liberty.”  The website Quote Investigator found the earliest instance of a variation of the expression in a 1917 speech by labor activist Eugene V. Debs. In the speech, Debs is quoted as saying, “Every robber or oppressor in history has wrapped himself in a cloak of patriotism or religion, or both.” There have been numerous other iterations of the quote in print throughout the 20th century, but it has only been attributed to Lewis in print since 2005, according to Quote Investigator.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

In fact, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey credited Paine as the source of the quote in a 2013 tweet. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say This Quote About Term Limits?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though Paine wrote widely on the subject of rights, there is no record of him ever saying or writing the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. It appears nowhere in his collected works. The Daily Caller reached out to several experts, all of whom confirmed that the quote did not originate with Paine. Two experts – Thomas Paine National Historical Association Secretary Gary Berton and Yale University Library Associate Editor Philipp Ziesche – did note, however, that Paine probably would have agreed with its sentiment. “This is not Paine, but it is his philosophy,” Berton told the Caller in an email. “I believe it is Robert Ingersoll, a great orator of the late 19th century who wrote and spoke in support of Paine’s philosophy.” Indeed, the statement does come from Ingersoll’s 1877 work “The Liberty of Man, Woman, and Child.” In this work, Ingersoll writes, “This is my doctrine: Give every other human being every right you claim for yourself.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/heavenlygrandmothers/posts/1233808163453021?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARAts0goaS_ZodK3NKTuc5X1s5xcngkkBuHRj3Qlyo155a3NYmL5zgtR9Trn_3mQZAKd0CcVMH7O7N3kcxJ7URdrj2FNeMkfILaCGPeyHj2v04MQJMMAYlgYZWDSS7u4-SiToxwJm6AUKvmDi7YUPc5NsdNptwXUSkQLQGZ3ohMDSY2O0wbc6bAQvEtFjW0M6S0FsSlRfjNm-_0dt83QnbT947kMWmJ8opxPTlotqYyNe4fDp1Roi85FD2MfObshqtRdHSgSegWp-6qIuZDI1NtFltco6VyBlbrGqRQTU4LVhRXYcsg4YmPmxexW4dyePd5qqE44qjettxNUk_2ROw&__xts__%5B1%5D=68.ARBlwwypmGpkj1dgRD_TBWYKSty9vAVqzVlORMewBhT4Lkf_YMR3OzMDrs9zl-_tys_7_zYa836KczBQumBnrtHDilvp6wVOyyre7lO6q1vDE3O5OoKSxL2MsGjSeat-W1QLx3fq7BJOIDv01d3hl2hsXuYLscUaQdA_VEaL6yOLEdoIsNhESD9LMS_StoLMIH24a-na5BoeF2v2nBoMKyFXYP5BGUEzqhC2OdgkVyjO73Jlb4JRUU8RlsET2k0m6voBw4kNYyVWiZjTrQs6rHgyiu7GXx1-socMuBeRY1vJq4asJvB7oiJLmvEPw-HDbyP05QnQZJ-ygMsSfuNf9Q&__tn__=-R,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-G-Ingersoll,https://twitter.com/jack/status/337351338503598080,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/18/fact-check-thomas-jefferson-rascals-government-serve-term-limits/,https://books.google.com/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=collected+writings+thomas+paine&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNkZKfrL7iAhWRjlkKHUn0A3gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22every%20right%20that%20you%20claim%20for%20yourself%22&f=false,https://thomaspaine.org/pages/about-paine.html,https://web.library.yale.edu/sd/staff/8429,https://archive.org/details/libertyofmanwomainge/page/346,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bbcfc9decdd4c9fbdfdad2d7c2d8dad7d7dec995d8d4d6","Did Thomas Paine Say, ‘Give To Every Other Human Being Every Right That You Claim For Yourself’?",,,,,

Verdict: False The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Ford ever said or wrote this expression. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “There is no failure except failure to serve one’s purpose,” said Ford in a 1923 edition of his newspaper. This quote is just one of many attributed to Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company. Yet, while there is clear evidence that Ford actually said this statement, that’s not the case for the expression attributed to him in the Facebook post. The DCNF keyword-searched the Henry Ford Museum’s digital archive for the statement, but found nothing resembling it. It also doesn’t appear in his autobiography “My Life and Work.” Though the Henry Ford Museum doesn’t comment on the veracity of alleged quotes as a matter of policy, the phrase is notably absent from the museum’s list of more than 200 verified quotations.  Etymologist Barry Popik traced a variation of the expression – “If you want to consider what ‘social security’ does for and to people look at the American Indian” – back to a 1935 column in The Evening Tribune newspaper. Citations that more closely resemble the quote have appeared from 1950 onward. For instance, one appears in May 1950 edition of a Boston newspaper, where the author wrote, “Observes a cynic: ‘If you think you’re going to be happy and prosperous by sitting back and letting the government take care of you, look at the American Indian.'”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The earliest known attribution to Ford doesn’t come until the 2000s, according to Popik. It’s unclear how or why the expression came to be associated with him.

Verdict: False  The Daily Caller News Foundation found no instance of the NYT calling Gabbard a “right-wing extremist.” Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The NYT published an article titled “What, Exactly, Is Tulsi Gabbard Up To?” on Oct. 12. In that article, reporter Lisa Lerer observed that an “unusual array of Americans” have expressed support for Gabbard. “On podcasts and online videos, in interviews and Twitter feeds, alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activists and some of the biggest boosters of Mr. Trump heap praise on Ms. Gabbard,” wrote Lerer. Gabbard, who threatened to boycott the recent Democratic primary debate in Ohio, called it a “smear piece” on Twitter.  As if to prove my point, NYT just published a “greatest hits” smear piece.

These are the folks who will be acting as the ‘neutral’ questioners/moderators of Tuesday’s debate lol.”  Some political commentators have argued that it portrays Gabbard as a “right-wing extremist,” and it’s possible that these characterizations of the article spurred the claim that appears in the Facebook post. Yet, while some have called it a “hit piece,” nowhere in the article was Gabbard labeled a “right-wing extremist,” as the Facebook post claims. The DCNF also searched for instances in the NYT archive but found none.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The NYT didn’t return a request for comment. Gabbard’s campaign has so far been defined by her anti-war, non-interventionist foreign policy stance and her break from other Democratic candidates, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, on such issues as the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump, abortion and decriminalization of illegal crossings at the southern border.

Freedom of religion, including having places of worship, is protected under the Polish Constitution. A search of Polish legislation found no laws restricting the construction of mosques. The Polish Embassy in London told Full Fact, a U.K.-based fact checking organization, that Poland had no policy of this nature. In 2018, Polish parliament member Dominik Tarczynski tweeted two statements similar to the claim in the Facebook post. He made another comment to Breitbart the same year, saying that Saudi Arabia could build a mosque in Warsaw “once they agree for Poland to build a cathedral in Saudi Arabia.” These statements may have spurred the false claim that Poland refuses to allow the construction of mosques until the country can build a Christian church in Saudi Arabia.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156363297602854&set=a.10150211507922854&type=3,https://www.brookings.edu/research/imaginary-muslims-how-polands-populists-frame-islam/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156363297602854&set=a.10150211507922854&type=3,https://www.facebook.com/oliver.charlotte.1232/posts/188477065464740,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/10/23/fact-check-trump-financial-interests-saudi-arabia/,https://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/kon1.htm,https://www.infor.pl/dziennik-ustaw/?szukaj=meczet,https://fullfact.org/online/poland-has-not-refused-building-mosques/,http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/AssemblyList/MP-Details-EN.asp?MemberID=7508,https://twitter.com/D_Tarczynski/status/955014713049538560?ref_src=twsrc%5etfw%7Ctwcamp%5etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5e955014713049538560&ref_url=https://www.dorzeczy.pl/kraj/53766/arabia-saudyjska-finansuje-meczet-tarczynski-polska-chce-zaplacic-za-budowe-katedry-w-arabii-saudyjskiej.html,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/08/28/polish-lawmaker-burqa-ban-no-saudi-arabia-mosques-europe-build-cathedrals/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3b7b1a6b5acb183a7a2aaafbaa0a2afafa6b1eda0acae",Has Poland Refused To Allow The Building Of Mosques?,,,,,

Verdict: False The Daily Caller found no evidence that Jefferson ever said or wrote this expression. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The internet is replete with both genuine and fake quotes attributed to the founding fathers. This particular Facebook post credits Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, with coining a saying about term limits, though it appears nowhere in his writings,  collected quotes or letters. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say,’Freedom Is Lost Gradually From An Uninterested, Uninformed, And Unresponsive People?’) Lisa Francavilla of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which runs his estate at Monticello, confirmed as much in an email to the Caller, also noting, “While TJ had some concerns about the potential for abuse by those we would today call ‘career politicians,’ he was optimistic that constitutionally mandated term limits would be unnecessary.” She pointed the Caller to two letters written by Jefferson that exemplify this “optimism”: a 1788 letter to Edward Rutledge, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and an 1814 letter to Horatio G. Spafford, a lawyer. In his letter to Rutledge, Jefferson expressed concern that the “total abandonment of the principle of rotation in the offices of President and Senator” would end in “abuse” but went on to say that he had confidence that there would be “virtue and good sense enough in our countrymen to correct abuses.”  Though Francavilla could not point to the exact source of the falsely attributed quote, she did find it linked to Jefferson in an “instance of a man who regularly portrays Thomas Jefferson.” Clay Jenkinson, creator of the weekly “Thomas Jefferson Hour” radio program, did indeed say the expression while answering questions in character as Jefferson during a 2017 episode titled “Term Limits.” On the radio program’s website, the saying is credited to Jefferson with the caveat “as portrayed by Clay S. Jenkinson.” This attribution may have led some readers to believe that Jenkinson was directly quoting Jefferson, rather than just basing his character of the “writings and actions of the great man,” as the website disclaims.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: Unsubstantiated   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  No available financial records show Burisma directly paid Hunter Biden. The $50,000-a-month figure stems from payments made to Biden by New York-based capital management firm Rosemont Seneca Bohai. Bank records show Rosemont Seneca Bohai received payments from Burisma, as well as dozens of other entities and individuals. It’s unclear why Rosemont Seneca Bohai was paying Hunter Biden. Fact Check:  Hunter Biden served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma while his father, then-Vice President Joe Biden, oversaw policy regarding the Eastern European nation. Hunter Biden, who served on the Burisma board of directors from April 2014 to April 2019, was paid a salary for his work with the company, according to a statement Burisma chairman Alan Apter gave to The Wall Street Journal. In his statement, Apter said Hunter Biden would receive a salary for his independent directorship, but did not specify how much Hunter Biden would be paid.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Numerous media outlets have stated Hunter Biden was paid as much as $50,000 a month for his work with Burisma, but available financial records show no direct payments from the company to him. The frequently cited figure stems from payments Hunter Biden received from Rosemont Seneca Bohai, a New York-based capital management firm owned and controlled by longtime business partner Devon Archer. Rosemont Seneca Bohai Morgan Stanley bank records show Hunter Biden, while simultaneously serving on Burisma’s board, received $708,302 between June 2014 and October 2015 from Rosemont Seneca Bohai, for undisclosed reasons, in a series of payments that ranged from $10,000 to $150,979 per month. At the same time, Rosemont Seneca Bohai received over $3.15 million from Burisma for “consulting services.” (Rosemont Seneca Bohai was a capital management firm, not a consulting firm.) Hunter Biden had no official role with Rosemont Seneca Bohai at the time of the payments, according to the company’s business filings. “Hunter Biden was a Yale-educated lawyer who had served on the boards of Amtrak and a number of nonprofit organizations and think tanks, but lacked any experience in Ukraine and just months earlier had been discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine,” wrote New York Times journalist Kenneth Vogel. “He would be paid as much as $50,000 per month in some months for his work for the company, Burisma Holdings.”  Vogel was the first to report Burisma paid Hunter Biden $50,000 per month. It’s unclear how exactly Vogel calculated that figure, but it is possible he used an average of the payments regularly made to Hunter Biden from Rosemont Seneca Bohai over the period of 17 months shown in the available bank records. However, the Daily Caller News Foundation could not confirm the accuracy of this figure, as there is no evidence the payments from Rosemont Seneca Bohai to Hunter Biden are necessarily for his work with Burisma.

The money Hunter Biden received from Rosemont Seneca Bohai could possibly be for his work with any of these other entities or individuals, or for some other unknown reason. When ABC News’s Amy Robach asked directly about the alleged $50,000 figure, Hunter Biden said, “Look, I’m a private citizen. One thing that I don’t have to do is sit here and open my kimono as it relates to how much money I made or make or did or didn’t.” Rosemont Seneca Bohai, Burisma, Kenneth Vogel and Hunter Biden’s lawyer, George Mesires, did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

The post alleges that it comes from “Alice In Wonderland,” but a keyword search of the 1951 and 2010 film adaptations with that name turned up no matches, and neither did the sequel to the 2010 movie. “Definitely not by Lewis Carroll,” said Edward Wakeling, a former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. The DCNF found an exact match for the quote in an episode of the ABC television series “Once Upon A Time” through an internet search. The show, which aired from 2011 to 2018, pulled characters and plot elements from popular fairy tales, including some of Carroll’s works. Jefferson, a character based on the Hatter in Carroll’s “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” says the following lines in episode 17 of season one: “You know what the issue is with this world? Everyone wants some magical solution to their problem, and everyone refuses to believe in magic.”  It’s possible this allusion to Carroll’s work may have led some to believe the line about magic in the episode was from Carroll.

The tweet has garnered more than 100,000 likes.  Only 25 percent want the President Impeached, which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage, but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong. It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019  Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The Daily Caller News Foundation found no polls showing 25% support for impeachment among Americans. FiveThirtyEight and numerous national polls put support closer to the 40-50% range. Fact Check: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced in late September that the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry following the allegation that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate a potential political rival. (RELATED: Did Vermont Gov. Phil Scott Vote To Impeach President Trump?) Trump, some noted, has tried to downplay the growing momentum to move forward with the impeachment inquiry, though Pelosi has since said the House will hold off on voting to authorize the formal inquiry for now.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Only 25 percent want the President Impeached, which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage, but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong,” Trump tweeted on Oct. 9. “It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!” Trump claims that “only 25 percent” of Americans support impeachment but, according to multiple polling experts, that number is significantly lower than any polls they’ve seen on the issue. “I don’t see a single poll that’s been conducted in the past month and a half that is even close to 25 percent,” Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts University, told the DCNF in an email. Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy said in an email to the DCNF, “Our numbers and the numbers of other reputable polls are nowhere close to that number.”  FiveThirtyEight, a data journalism website known for its presidential election forecasts, found that 50.2% of Americans support impeachment proceedings and 43.8% do not, as of Wednesday. Those figures come from an aggregation of polls taken on the issue since Aug. 1, based on an “updating calculation of support for and opposition to impeachment, accounting for each poll’s quality, recency, sample size and partisan lean.” (Polls asking if Trump should simply be impeached and those asking if he should be impeached and removed from office were included.) Polling from Quinnipiac University, Ipsos, Fox News, Morning Consultant, HarrisX and NBC News all show support for impeachment in the 40 to 50% range in the week leading up to Trump’s tweet. FiveThirtyEight put support at nearly half for all Americans on Oct. 8.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   Graphic: the Daily Caller News Foundation  Further breaking down the data, FiveThirtyEight found support for impeachment largely depends on party identification, with 82.1% of Democrats in favor compared to 14.4% of Republicans on Oct. 8, the day before Trump made his claim on Twitter.  Graphic: the Daily Caller News Foundation  Rasmussen Reports, a polling organization frequently cited by Trump, has also found support for impeachment among Americans to be well higher than 25% in recent months. In May, Rasmussen released a poll that put support for impeachment at 40%. It’s possible that Trump may have pulled the figure from internal polling data, but several polling experts speculated that, even if this was the case, that percentage may not give an accurate picture of public opinion. Robert Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia University, speculated in an email to the DCNF: It is possible it is internal polling. But we need to see the question wording and also the order of questions in the survey which affect later responses. The one thing to find out is what are the results for impeachment questions asked in surveys that use voter lists as their sampling frame rather than a random digit dialing or other method of surveying/sampling. Or does the 25% include only voters in Republican primaries which would be Republicans and also Independent who could vote in open primaries. The 25% is clearly a big outlier. A Washington Post-Schar School poll does put support for impeachment at 25%, but that figure only captures the responses of Republican and Republican-leaning Independents, not Americans overall. Fifty-eight percent of Americans support impeachment, and 49% support removal of Trump from office, according to the same poll. Trump may be citing the 25% figure from that poll. If that’s the case, his tweet lacked important context clarifying which segment of respondents this percentage actually reflected. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

There is no mention of the three U.S. politicians in testimony from his sentencing trial either. Fact Check: Known by the nickname “El Chapo,” Guzmán is the former head of the Sinaloa cartel, widely considered one of the world’s most powerful drug-trafficking organizations.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    He was convicted on 10 counts related to federal drug offenses in February, following extradition to the U.S. and a lengthy trial, reports The Associated Press. The Facebook post, which likely stems from another post that garnered more than 30,000 shares, claims that Guzmán testified in court that he gave millions of dollars to Clinton, Pelosi and Schiff. The drug kingpin, however, never testified that he made payments to U.S. politicians. In fact, Guzmán didn’t take the stand at any point in his three-month trial. He was listed as a potential witness for the defense but never actually testified, according to reports from numerous media outlets. His defense team only called one witness, and it was an FBI agent, not Guzmán. Colombian drug lord Alex Cifuentes Villa testified that Guzmán’s cartel bribed numerous Mexican officials, including former Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, but there is no mention of the three U.S. politicians’ names at any point.  A search for Pelosi, Schiff and Clinton’s names in the transcript of his July sentencing hearing also yielded no instances.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/704135299624955/photos/a.1312175108820968/2429991237039344/?type=3&theater,https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/el-chapo-joaquin-guzman-loera,https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/el-chapo-sentencing/h_6d3bdd62220e9596776ec50c82a060ea,https://www.apnews.com/1d5b01e6b8ee4dd29319349bcebc1dcd,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/el-chapo-testify-clinton-pelosi/?fbclid=IwAR1gCF3juMlXWXoqRp5QiknoYP12sMtpMgOsBahOxzEHcWYjCJSACMxJLxI,https://web.archive.org/web/20190212151920/https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2036227633092931&id=100001171413008&__tn__=H-R,https://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/2018/050718-wls-chapo-venue-doc.pdf,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/01/26/joaquin-el-chapo-guzman-sinaloa-drug-cartel-trial-witness-stand-defense/2677166002/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/nyregion/el-chapo-trial.html?module=inline,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mexico-el-chapo/el-chapo-says-he-will-not-testify-in-his-own-defense-idUSKCN1PM2JC,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/29/us/el-chapo-defense/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-mexico-el-chapo/el-chapo-defense-rests-after-calling-one-witness-idUSKCN1PN2TV,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/nyregion/el-chapo-trial.html?module=inline,https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6206410/071719-01-BMC-0915-09cr00466-USA-v-Joaquin.pdf,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3878196859c81b397929a9f8a90929f9f9681dd909c9e","Meme Claims El Chapo Testified That He Gave Money To Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi And Adam Schiff",,,,,
581,,,,False,,,,checkyourfact,,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/15/fact-check-marcus-aurelius-opinion-fact-perspective-truth-quote/,"Did Marcus Aurelius Say, ‘Everything We Hear Is An Opinion, Not A Fact’?",2019-10-15,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: Did Marcus Aurelius Say, ‘Everything We Hear Is An Opinion, Not A Fact’?10:02 AM 10/15/2019Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsA post shared on Facebook claims ancient Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius once said, “Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  There is no evidence that Aurelius ever said or wrote this saying. Fact Check:  Aurelius, who ruled Rome as emperor from 161 to 180 A.D., was a proponent and practitioner of Stoicism, a philosophy that emphasizes a rational, pragmatic approach to life. He even wrote a series of 12 books, eventually compiled and titled “Meditations,” in which he outlined his personal Stoic philosophy.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in this work, or any of Aurelius’s other writings, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. It appears to be apocryphal. “That’s a fake quote,” said Donald Robertson, author of “How to Think Like a Roman Emperor: The Stoic Philosophy of Marcus Aurelius,” in an email to the DCNF. Stephen Hanselman, author of “The Daily Stoic,” pointed out that it resembles other statements found in “Meditations.” “It’s very loose expansion of what Marcus wrote in The Meditations 4.3 where he says: ‘our disturbances come only from our own opinions … everything that we see will change and no longer exist … the universe is change and life is opinion,'” said Hanselman in an email to the DCNF. “This layering on of ‘alternative facts and truths’ is a current obsession, I’m afraid.”  Because Aurelius’s work was originally written in the Koine Greek, the wording of the lines that Hanselman references in his email often depends on which translation of “Meditations” is being consulted. It’s likely the quote originated as an attempted translation or paraphrase from a passage in “Meditations” that was then confused as a direct quote from Aurelius.

Verdict: False.  The quote does not appear in any of the Federalist Papers. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Founding fathers Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay published a series of 85 essays known as the Federalist Papers under the pseudonym Publius in late 1780s. The essays urged New York voters to support the ratification of the proposed U.S. Constitution, which had been drafted during the 1787 Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. However, nowhere in any of the Federalist Papers does the statement attributed to the series of 85 essays appear. A search of the Federalist Papers, provided by Project Gutenberg, did not yield any results for the quote. No variations of the expression appear in the essays either. “Definitely not in the Federalist [Papers] and not the purpose of the Constitution,” George Washington University law professor Maeva Marcus wrote in an email to the Daily Caller. R.B. Bernstein, a New York Law School adjunct law professor and the author of “The Founding Fathers Reconsidered,” told the Caller in an email that it was “common sense” that the purpose of the Constitution was to limit the powers of the federal government.  “After all, the whole point of the guys who created [the Federalist Papers] was to write an elaborate and learned brief in favor of the Constitution,” Bernstein wrote. “They would not be talking about limiting the people or the powers of the people; instead, they were talking about the people both empowering their new government and limiting the powers of that government.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Most published at least one article on their websites. CBS News, MSNBC, and PBS did not cover the case at all. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Family members discovered the medically-preserved remains of more than 2,200 fetuses on the property of deceased Illinois abortion doctor Ulrich “George” Klopfer in early September, according to a Will County press release. Additional remains, likely also from the time period of 2000 to 2002, were recovered Oct. 10, reports the Daily Caller. This image, which has been shared more than 1,100 times, alleges that CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, NPR and PBS did not “dedicate a single minute” to cover the case. “This is one of the sickest things I’ve EVER heard,” reads part of the screen-grabbed tweet. “So why did the media suppress it?” National coverage has been sparse as the case unfolds, but it’s inaccurate to say that mainstream media outlets haven’t reported on it at all. Several mentioned in the Facebook post discussed the case in broadcasts, and most ran digital stories on their websites. NPR ran a three-minute, 48-second segment on its flagship radio news program “All Things Considered.” It also included the case in its live summaries of breaking news headlines that typically run at the top and bottom of each hour on at least four days, according to NPR spokeswoman Isabel Lara.  CNN’s Ana Cabrera discussed the case during a Sept. 14 broadcast, and local reporter Will Jones did a segment for ABC News Live. These two latter instances were less than one minute. The Daily Caller found no video footage from NBC News, MSNBC, CBS News or PBS on Grabien, a video clip editing service. (RELATED: Have There Been 60 Million Abortions Since Roe V. Wade?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  NBC, CBS and PBS affiliate stations, however, did cover the story, with broadcast segments and online articles. CBS 2 interviewed an Indiana woman who had abortions performed by Klopfer, for example. Most of the mainstream media outlets mentioned in the Facebook post – NBC News, CNN, NPR and ABC News – published at least one article. CNN posted four original stories, the highest number of all the outlets, excluding wire stories. (ABC News put up at least 10 articles, but they all seem to be from The Associated Press.) Searches of PBS, CBS News and MSNBC‘s websites turned up no stories on the preserved fetal remains discovered on Klopfer’s property. ABC News, CBS News, MSNBC, NBC News and PBS have not responded to the Caller’s requests for comment.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

His estate at Mount Vernon includes the expression on its list of “spurious quotations.” Fact Check: George Washington, the first U.S. president and a prominent figure in the Revolutionary War, has been credited with coining a multitude of quotes about firearms, governance and citizens’ rights. (RELATED: Did George Washington Say, ‘Firearms Stand Next In Importance To The Constitution Itself?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    There’s no evidence, however, that this particular quote about firearms originated with Washington. The Daily Caller searched his writings and recorded speeches, but neither collection yielded any similar or matching phrases. Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon also includes the expression on its list of “spurious quotations.” “The quote seems to originate from an online publication: The American Wisdom Series presents Pamphlet #230, ‘President George Washington’s Thoughts on Firearms,'” states the Mount Vernon website. “The author provides no citation for the quotations used.” Indeed, it appears unattributed in the pamphlet written by one Joe Spenner. The statement may have originated with him, as he includes it in the section of the pamphlet that appears to be his own commentary. The rest of the pamphlet contains sayings about firearms that are attributed to Washington, though some of those are also spurious. The pamphlet has been online since at least 2002, according to etymologist Barry Popik.  “The anti-gun saying is often accompanied with a photo of Dianne Feinstein, a senator from California who frequently sponsors gun control legislation,” noted Popik.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Trump held a campaign rally Oct. 10 in Minneapolis. It was the first such event since Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House would initiate a formal impeachment inquiry against the president. (RELATED: 3 Claims From Trump’s Rally In Minnesota)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This image, shared more than 500 times since being posted Oct. 11, allegedly depicts a large crowd of Trump supporters outside Target Center, the arena where the Minnesota rally was held. However, it does not actually show people outside that rally. Instead, the picture depicts a crowd attending the Cleveland Cavaliers 2016 NBA Championship victory parade in Ohio that year. In the 2016 NBA Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors team to bring the first professional sports championship title to the city in nearly 50 years. The parade, held on June 22, 2016, was attended by around 1.3 million people, according to ESPN. Despite the photograph being miscaptioned, the Facebook post uses the image to argue that Trump has public support, with the caption reading, ” I guess these are the 49% that don’t want Trump impeached.” That percentage likely refers to an early October poll by Fox News, released Oct. 9, in which 51 percent of respondents indicated that they support the impeachment and removal of Trump. Of the remaining respondents, 40 percent expressed opposition to his impeachment, not 49 percent. Four percent of respondents supported impeachment but not removal, and 5 percent reported that they didn’t know.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/farrightofleft/photos/a.208239875988721/1896447647167927/?type=3&theater,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/11/trump-somali-refugees-minneapolis-rally/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/10/11/fact-check-claims-donald-trump-rally-minneapolis-isis-refugee-china-trade-war/,https://www.facebook.com/farrightofleft/photos/a.208239875988721/1896447647167927/?type=3&theater,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/cleveland-fans-celebrate-during-the-cleveland-cavaliers-news-photo/542168322?adppopup=true,https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html,https://www.news5cleveland.com/sports/basketball/cavaliers/its-been-3-years-since-the-cavs-championship-parade-but-it-feels-like-yesterday,https://www.espn.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16408697/fans-toast-cleveland-cavaliers-downtown-parade,https://www.facebook.com/farrightofleft/photos/a.208239875988721/1896447647167927/?type=3&theater,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-results-october-6-8-2019,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9eeaecfbe8f1ecdefafff7f2e7fdfff2f2fbecb0fdf1f3",Does This Image Show The Crowd Outside Trump’s Minnesota Rally?,,,,,

He has also been the subject of conspiracy theories for years. (RELATED: Does This Picture Show Greta Thunberg With George Soros?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image, which has been shared nearly 500 times, shows a young man in a military uniform adorned with the emblem of the Schutzstaffel (SS), the Nazi paramilitary organization that ran the concentration camps. “This is George Soros,” reads the caption. “Remember this the next time the Soros-funded liberals call you a racist, fascist, or Nazi.” A reverse image search reveals that the man in the image is not, in fact, Soros. It’s actually Groening, a former SS sergeant who oversaw the collection of prisoners’ belongings at the Auschwitz concentration camp and separated their cash and valuables to be sent to Berlin. He was convicted of being an accessory to murder of 300,000 Jews in 2015, but died before serving his prison sentence, reports BBC News. Soros, who was only 14 years old during the Nazi occupation of Hungary, was not a member of the SS, contrary to what the Facebook post claims. He would have officially been too young to join the SS and, as a Hungarian Jew, would not have met the “Aryan” heritage requirement. His family forged government documents to hide their Jewish identities and bribed a Christian government official to claim Soros as his godson during the Nazi occupation, according to BBC News.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Thomas Jefferson, a founding father and later the third president, has frequently been credited with quotes on governance. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say,’Freedom Is Lost Gradually From An Uninterested, Uninformed, And Unresponsive People?’)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Daily Caller found no evidence that the statement originated with Jefferson. A search of the Papers of Thomas Jefferson yielded no results. The quote doesn’t appear anywhere in a collection of his quotes and letters either. The Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which maintains his estate at Monticello, includes the quote on its running list of “spurious quotations.” “It seems to exist mainly on Twitter,” writes research librarian Anna Berkes on the Monticello website. “But we have been unable to trace its existence before 2015.” Indeed, the Caller traced the quote back to the same year. The earliest known instance of the saying being attributed to Jefferson appears in an October 2015 tweet from user Ziad K. Abdelnour, though there may be prior occurrences.  It’s unclear whether this Twitter user originated the quote or simply perpetuated an already circulating one.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company, revolutionized the automobile industry with his use of the assembly line to mass-produce Model T cars, widely considered the first affordable automobile. As such, he is often quoted in the context of business and entrepreneurship.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appears to be apocryphal. The DCNF keyword-searched the Henry Ford Museum’s digital archive for the statement, but found nothing matching it. It doesn’t appear in his autobiography “My Life and Work,” either. Furthermore, the Henry Ford Museum does not include the saying on its list of more than 200 verified quotations from the automobile manufacturer. A variation of the expression was first connected to Ford in a 1999 cruise industry publication, though elements of the saying appeared earlier in other contexts, according to the website Quote Investigator. In this instance, the author did not credit Ford directly with the statement. “There is a problem trying to figure out what people want by canvassing them,” wrote cruise ship designer John McNeece, reported Quote Investigator. “I mean, if Henry Ford canvassed people on whether or not he should build a motor car, they’d probably tell him what they really wanted was a faster horse.”  The earliest attribution to Ford occurred in a 2001 letter sent to British publication Marketing Week, decades after Ford’s death in 1947.

They actually left because the wait time was too long. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Fonda, star of award-winning films like “Coming Home” and “Klute,” has been politically vocal through her career, publicly opposing the Vietnam War during the 70s. In 2003, the story of Fonda being thrown out of a Montana restaurant as a result of her activism began circulating online and eventually migrated to Facebook. (RELATED: Is US Defense Spending At Near-Historic Lows?) She and her then-husband and CNN founder Ted Turner tried to use their celebrity status to get seated before other diners at Sir Scott’s Oasis Steakhouse in Montana, according to the Facebook post. The owner, identified in the post as a Vietnam veteran, allegedly denied them service due to her anti-war activism. “I am the owner of this restaurant and I am a Vietnam Veteran,” the owner supposedly told Fonda and Turner. “Not only will you not get a table ahead of my friends and neighbors who have been waiting here, But (sic) you also will not be eating in my restaurant tonight or any other night.” However, there is no evidence that this interaction ever took place. An internet search revealed no credible sources reporting that she was denied service, only those debunking the story.  Fonda and Turner did visit the restaurant and leave without being served, according to Snopes, but not due to her war protests. Owner Scott Westphal, who is not a Vietnam veteran, told Belgrade News that they left by choice because the wait time was too long without reservations. The couple returned to the restaurant numerous times after their initial visit, according to a Vietnam Veteran News podcast.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/Lon.krueger/posts/10212235808525473,https://www.facebook.com/Lon.krueger/posts/10212235808525473,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000404/awards?ref_=nm_awd,https://www.altfg.com/film/coming-home-jane-fonda/,https://www.criterion.com/films/28708-klute,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jane-Fonda,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/09/18/how-jane-fondas-1972-trip-to-north-vietnam-earned-her-the-nickname-hanoi-jane/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jane-fonda-sir-scotts-oasis-steakhouse/,https://www.facebook.com/notes/william-pratt/montana-restaurant/74344946740/,https://checkyourfact.com/2017/11/16/fact-check-is-us-defense-spending-at-near-historic-lows/,https://www.facebook.com/Lon.krueger/posts/10212235808525473,https://www.facebook.com/Lon.krueger/posts/10212235808525473,https://www.facebook.com/Lon.krueger/posts/10212235808525473,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/jane-fonda-sir-scotts-oasis-steakhouse/,http://www.belgrade-news.com/news/sir-scott-s-receives-owner-of-the-year-award/article_77f2ca2e-09be-11e7-a429-7b959c83b5dc.html,http://vietnamveterannews.com/217-2/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#592d2b3c2f362b193d383035203a3835353c2b773a3634",Was Jane Fonda Denied Service At A Restaurant Run By A Vietnam Veteran?,,,,,

The Facebook post alludes to this inquiry, as well as the conspiracy theory that Obama was ineligible to be president because he wasn’t born in the U.S.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “While we’re at it,” reads the allegedly screen-grabbed tweet, “ask Ukraine if they found my birth certificate.” (RELATED: Did Rashida Tlaib Say, ‘Americans Have Spent Decades Raping And Pillaging My People’?) At first glance, it could appear authentic to some. The tweet bears the Twitter handle of Obama’s personal account, his current profile picture and blue verification check mark. However, there is no record of Obama ever tweeting this statement from his verified Twitter account. An internet search failed to turn up any evidence corroborating the tweet as well. The 44th president is not the only politician who has fallen victim to inauthentic tweets. In recent months, Check Your Fact has debunked fake tweets believed by many to be from Trump, Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and several others.

Fact Check: Trump’s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, had five children, including Donald. His father worked as a real estate developer in New York City, and his mother, a Scottish immigrant, supported various charitable causes.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 230 times, shows the Trumps dressed in KKK robes while posing for a photo with their son, who’s wearing a suit and red tie. “Mary and Fred Trump with son Donald in their KKK outfits, 1999,” reads the caption. However, a reverse image search reveals that the original photograph, found on Shutterstock, has been manipulated. KKK robes have been digitally inserted over Fred and Mary Trump’s regular clothing, and the background has been simplified. It also appears to have been flipped. Shutterstock and another stock photo website also date the image back to the early 90s – not 1999, as the Facebook post claims. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims To Show The KKK Marching At The 1924 Democratic National Convention)  Trump’s father was arrested in 1927 at a KKK parade in Queens, New York, after Klansmen clashed with police, but there is not enough documentation to determine his involvement in the event.

The American republic will endure until the day Congress discovers it can bribe the public with the public’s money – Alexis De Tocqueville — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 3, 2012  Verdict: False It does not appear in any of de Tocqueville’s writings or speeches. Variations of the quote have appeared in print since at least 1951.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Fact Check: Tocqueville, a 19th century French author and political scientist, is best known for his two-volume work “Democracy in America,” in which he recounts the nine months he spent traveling and observing the U.S. However, the Daily Caller found no record of the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post in “Democracy in America,” or any of his other written works. “Nothing like this appears in ‘Democracy in America,'” Robert Tracy McKenzie, a history professor at Wheaton College, told the Caller in an email.  “The sentiment contained in the quote you refer to sounds like nothing Tocqueville would have argued,” added McKenzie. “The entire thrust of volume I is concerned not with how the government might corrupt the people, but the ways in which popular pressure may corrupt democratic government and render it simply an instrument for the ‘tyranny of the majority.'” An internet search revealed that it may actually be a variation of a statement frequently misattributed to Scottish academic and author Alexander Fraser Tytler. He is credited with saying, “A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  This expression also seems to be spurious, according to “Yale Book of Quotations” editor Fred Shapiro. “In The Yale Book of Quotations, for which I tried to trace all famous quotations to their accurate origins, the earliest version I found for this passage was in the New York Times Book Review, May 3, 1959,” wrote Shapiro in a 2009 blog post. “And the earliest attribution to Alexander Fraser Tytler I found was in Martin Dies, The Martin Dies Story (1963).” Shapiro later found an earlier instance of the longer quote, which is also often attributed to Tocqueville, in a 1951 edition of the Daily Oklahoman newspaper.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

It actually comes from the 2002 film adaptation of Dickens’ book “Nicholas Nickleby.” Fact Check: One of the most widely read Victorian writers, Dickens authored a number of classic novels, including “A Christmas Carol,” “A Tale of Two Cities” and “Great Expectations.” (RELATED: Did George Eliot Say, ‘Wear A Smile And Have Friends’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in these works, or any of his others, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of the Dickens Project Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz didn’t return any matches. It doesn’t appear in his journals either. “I don’t think it’s Dickens (it doesn’t even sound like him),” said Pamela Dalziel, an associate professor at the University of Victoria, in an email to the DCNF. “The quotation is supposedly from Nicholas Nickleby but isn’t in the novel.” According to Dalziel, the quote actually stems from the script of director Douglas McGrath’s “Nicholas Nickleby,” a 2002 movie based on Dickens’ novel of the same name. The script was written by McGrath and, though some sections of dialogue may pull directly from the book, this quote about happiness was invented by the director. In a 2003 Variety article about his writing process, McGrath confirmed that he originated this particular expression.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted out a video that she said shows a hydraulic fracturing site releasing toxic emissions. The video has been retweeted more than 13,500 times. WATCH:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });   I’m in Colorado w/ @JoeNeguse visiting communities whose air is being poisoned by fracking. What we’re seeing is appalling. Companies are building fracking sites on public lands, across the street from schools + homes. Their toxic emissions are invisible. This camera sees them. pic.twitter.com/Kem0MT1lMj — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 21, 2019  Verdict: Unsubstantiated  There is no hydraulic fracturing currently taking place at the rig shown in Ocasio-Cortez’s video. Infrared cameras have the ability to pick up toxic emissions, but experts disagree on whether this footage shows that. Fact Check: Ocasio-Cortez stopped at a well site in Broomfield on Sept. 21 as part of her visit to Colorado, where she also attended Boulder County’s Truman Dinner and a Green New Deal event at a local high school.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “What we’re seeing is appalling. Companies are building fracking sites on public lands, across the street from schools + homes,” she tweeted. “Their toxic emissions are invisible. This camera sees them.” The video included in her tweet alternates between filming what environmental nonprofit Earthworks identifies as one of Extraction Oil & Gas’ rigs at the Livingston Pad and the screen of an infrared camera pointing in the site’s direction. Off-screen, an unnamed man explains the captured images to the congresswoman. Ocasio-Cortez refers to the rig as a “fracking site” in her tweet but, according to multiple oil and gas experts, no hydraulic fracturing is taking place there. “The video is of a drilling rig. There is indeed no fracking (hydraulic fracturing) going on at that location,” said Chris Wright, chief executive officer of Liberty Oilfield Services, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation.  The Colorado Oil and Gas Association (COGA) confirmed that no fracking is currently occurring at this site either. Ocasio-Cortez further claimed that the images captured on the infrared camera show the extraction site releasing harmful emissions – and she’s not the only one. Earthworks, whose representatives were present during the congresswoman’s Broomfield visit and took the original infrared footage, also interpreted the video as showing toxic emissions, according to a press release.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Infrared cameras can pick up toxic emissions being released into the atmosphere, several experts told the DCNF, but to do so requires a trained operator. “A Forward-Looking Infrared Radar (FLIR) camera like the one being used in the video can identify emissions,” COGA spokesman Scott Prestidge said in an email to the DCNF. “But it also picks up thermal differentials, such as heat, so it’s very important that whoever is using the camera is trained to understand and identify the various elements within the image itself.” Sharon Wilson, a certified optical gas imaging thermographer employed by Earthworks, said in an Earthworks press release that the footage does show toxic emissions. However, other oil and gas experts examined the footage and found it less conclusive. As Prestidge noted, there can be confusion regarding infrared imaging. “No one can make a claim with certainty as to what is being emitted, whether it’s toxic or not toxic – or even what it is,” said Jim Seffrin, a practicing thermographer with more than 35 years of experience who also serves as the director of the Infraspection Institute, a New Jersey-based firm that trains and certifies thermographers. Brian Cain, a spokesman for Extraction Oil & Gas, told the DCNF that it was actually steam from hot drilling mud in the video. “Using an infrared camera, the Congresswoman claimed to see ‘invisible emissions,’ when she was actually witnessing a heat signature caused by high-temperature (200-plus degrees) synthetic drilling mud being circulated to the surface against cooler fall temperatures in Broomfield,” Brian Cain, a spokesman for Extraction Oil & Gas, told the DCNF. Quarterly testing conducted at the site by Ajax Analytics found that any and all emissions from the rig remained “well below standard health guidelines.” Mary Throne, a Democratic public service commissioner in Wyoming, seems to have been the first to raise objections with Ocasio-Cortez’s claims.  Interesting video, but @AOC there is no fracking occurring at the site as shown and no way to determine compliance or lack thereof with CO air standards. As Dems, we do ourselves no favors when we ignore science and facts. Happy to discuss energy and the West any time. https://t.co/zI2WBXeGM2 — Mary A. Throne (@wymatters) September 22, 2019  “Interesting video, but @AOC there is no fracking occurring at the site as shown and no way to determine compliance or lack thereof with CO air standards,” Throne tweeted. “As Dems, we do ourselves no favors when we ignore science and facts.

Verdict: False While McCarthy did criticize video games in an August interview with Fox News, he made no mention of Japan. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo interviewed McCarthy on her “Sunday Morning Futures” program Aug. 4 to discuss the mass shootings in Texas and Ohio that left more than 30 people dead. During the interview, Bartiromo asked McCarthy a question about video games and violent behavior. “The idea of these video games that dehumanize individuals to have a game  of shooting individuals and others – I’ve always  felt that is a problem for future generations and others,” answered McCarthy. “We’ve watched from studies shown before of what it does to individuals. When you look at these photos of how it took place, you can see the actions within video games and others.” At no point, however, did McCarthy ever bring up Japan in his appearance on Bartiromo’s show. No credible online sources link McCarthy to the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post either.  The image likely stems from a viral tweet that has since been deleted. Prior to its deletion, the tweet had garnered more than 3,500 retweets and 8,000 likes, according to the Wayback Machine. Other Republicans, including Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and President Donald Trump, discussed violent video games during the wake of the mass shootings.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsElias AtienzaFact Check ReporterFollow Elias on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Its rescue was not related to any wildfires. Fact Check: The Amazon Rainforest has been impacted by a record number of forest fires in recent months, reports Newsweek. Mazeika Sullivan, an associate professor at Ohio State University’s School of Environment and Natural Resources, told National Geographic that the wildfires have taken a “massive toll on wildlife in the short term.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The picture does not, however, depict an animal affected by these wildfires. A reverse image search reveals that it actually shows a jaguar swimming with a Brazilian soldier in the river near Manaus, the state capital of Amazonas. None Mangeira, a Brazilian photographer, took the picture in 2016, according to her Facebook page. “It has nothing to do with the fires,” Mangueira told the Associated Press in an interview. The jaguar, named Jiquitaia, was adopted by the Brazilian army after hunters killed its mother, according to her. It was two years old at the time of the photograph, which was taken for a conservation project.

But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, each of us will have two ideas.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  There is no evidence that Shaw ever said or wrote this saying. Fact Check:  Shaw was an Irish playwright and political activist who lived from 1856 to 1950. He wrote more than 60 plays, including “Man and Superman,” “Pygmalion” and “Saint Joan,” and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in any of these works, or any of Shaw’s others, does the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appear. A search of Yale University’s collection of his correspondence and manuscripts didn’t return any results either. “It doesn’t sound like the kind of thing Shaw would say although he did like mind games,” Jay Tunney, author of “The Prizefighter and the Playwright: Gene Tunney and Bernard Shaw,” said in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “In fact he was highly analytical. But this doesn’t feel like him.” Richard Dietrich, the former president of the International Shaw Society, was not familiar with the quote either, telling the DCNF in an email, “I’ve never come across that, so I suspect that it’s just one more of dozens of misattributions to Shaw that you’ll find on the internet.” The website Quote Investigator traced the expression back to a 1917 magazine advertisement, though variations may have appeared earlier. In this early version, the word “dollar” was used instead of “apple.”  Charles Brannan, the secretary of agriculture at the time, also employed a similar expression during a 1944 talk show appearance, where he discussed the sharing of knowledge and ideas with other countries, according to Quote Investigator. It is possible that he popularized the version that uses the word “apples” and may even have originated it. The saying was first attributed to Shaw during a 1974 speech given at a Library Administrators Conference, according to Quote Investigator.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Verdict: False  Massachusetts recently implemented a four-month ban on the sale of all vaping and e-cigarette products, but vaping itself has not been banned. There are no supervised injection sites in the state.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Fact Check:  Republican Gov. Charlie Baker announced a four-month temporary ban on the sale of all vaping and e-cigarette products last week. The ban comes as more than a thousand vaping-related lung illnesses have been reported across the country, including at least 83 in Massachusetts. There have been 1,080 cases of vaping-related lung illnesses reported in the U.S. and its territories, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Eighteen of those cases have proven fatal, according to federal health data released Thursday. It’s still unclear what exactly is making people sick, though many patients used black market products containing THC (the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana) oil that many people believe is being diluted with “thickening agents.” Illicit, counterfeit products from China are finding their ways into the legal marijuana market, according to officials and shopkeepers cited by the Washington Post. Massachusetts and several other states have instituted bans of some form on vapes and e-cigarette products in response to the burgeoning number of cases.  “The purpose of this public health emergency is to temporarily pause all sales of vaping products so that we can work with our medical experts to identify what is making people sick and how to better regulate these products to protect the health of our residents,” said Baker in a statement. The ban does not, however, extend to the use of vapes and e-cigarettes already in circulation, as the meme claims.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Even if Massachusetts’ ban did prohibit use of already purchased products (to be clear, it does not), it would be impossible to ban vaping from safe injection sites, as there aren’t any in the state. Such facilities — which have had successful results in Canada but are inconclusive to some experts — offer medical supervision to drug users in an effort to limit the number of overdose deaths from heroin and other opioids. Some Massachusetts doctors and lawmakers have advocated for them in recent months, but laws against using most of the drugs have prevented any from opening in the state. In late August, Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone announced a plan to open a safe injection site next year, though it’s still unclear if or when it will actually happen.

The expression was actually written by L.H. Matthews in his introduction to an 1872 edition of Darwin’s work, “On the Origin of Species.” Fact Check: A biologist active during the 19th century, Darwin is widely regarded as a pioneer of biological evolutionary theory. Darwin’s 1859 book “On the Origin of Species” explains his theory of natural selection, whereby organisms better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While Darwin spoke and wrote widely on a number of scientific subjects, he did not author the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. It appears nowhere in Darwin Online, a database of his collected works, nor in any of his letters. An internet search reveals that the University of Cambridge’s Darwin Correspondence Project categorizes the statement as misattributed on its list of “Six things Darwin never said.” According to their researchers, the expression actually comes Matthews’ introduction to the 1872 edition  of “On the Origin of Species,” though it has been slightly misquoted. “The fact of evolution is the backbone of biology, and biology is thus in the peculiar position of being a science founded on an unproved theory, is it then a science or faith?” Matthews wrote in his introduction.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218485813407466&set=a.2835034885857&type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin/Evolution-by-natural-selection-the-London-years-1836-42,https://www.amazon.com/origin-species-Charles-Darwin-ebook/dp/B008478VE8,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20selection,http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/search-results?pagesize=50&sort=date-ascending&pageno=0&freetext=%22is+it+then+a+science+or+faith%3F%22&allfields=&searchid=&name=Darwin+Charles+Robert&dateafter=&datebefore=&searchtitle=&description=&place=&publisher=&periodical=,https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/search/?keyword=%22and+biology+is+thus+in+the+peculiar+position+of+being+a+science+founded+on+an+improved+theory%2C+is+it+then%22&tab=,https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/about/who-we-are,https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/people/about-darwin/six-things-darwin-never-said#quote6,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c181e091a031e2c080d0500150f0d0000091e420f0301",Did Charles Darwin Say This Quote About Biology?,,,,,

Fact Check: Millions of people across the U.S. protested on Sept. 20 in conjunction with the student-led Global Climate Strike movement to demand urgent action on climate change, including several thousand participants in Chicago, reported the Chicago Sun-Times. (RELATED: Is Climate Change A ‘Bigger Fiscal Issue’ Than Entitlements?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image, which shows plastic bags and bottles strew across the ground, alleges that climate protestors left trash behind in an attempt to paint them as hypocritical. “Aftermath of ‘Climate Change’ protests today!” reads the caption. “At Hyde Park, Chicago.” However, the photograph shared on Facebook does not capture the aftermath of a climate change protest, in Chicago or anywhere else. A reverse image search reveals that the picture actually shows the trash left behind by attendees of a marijuana-based celebration at London’s Hyde Park on April 20. The Hemp Trading Company, an eco-friendly fashion company based out of London, criticized those who attended the event on Facebook the following day.   “This is #HydePark after #420,” reads the post. “Ashamed is not the word. With #extinctionrebellion not yards away, so many of you couldn’t be bothered to clean up after yourselves.” The image was likely first linked to climate change protests after April 21 tweets falsely claimed that it showed the aftermath of a protest by environmental activist group Extinction Rebellion, which was held on the same day as the marijuana celebration.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/1600840463266204/photos/a.1600847983265452/3014681318548771/?type=3&theater,https://www.vox.com/2019/9/17/20864740/greta-thunberg-youth-climate-strike-fridays-future,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/9/20/20875917/chicago-climate-strike-walkout-grant-park-federal-plaza,https://checkyourfact.com/2017/10/25/fact-check-is-climate-change-a-bigger-fiscal-issue-than-entitlements/,https://www.facebook.com/1600840463266204/photos/a.1600847983265452/3014681318548771/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/1600840463266204/photos/a.1600847983265452/3014681318548771/?type=3&theater,https://shop.thtc.co.uk/,https://www.facebook.com/THTC1/photos/a.96904099348/10157525788004349/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/THTC1/photos/a.96904099348/10157525788004349/?type=3&theater,https://twitter.com/wrightspur/status/1119919468799569922,https://rebellion.earth/event/this-is-an-emergency-marble-arch/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#790d0b1c0f160b391d181015001a1815151c0b571a1614",Does This Image Show Trash Left By Climate Change Protestors In Chicago?,,,,,

It appears to have originated with white nationalist writer Kevin Alfred Strom. Fact Check:  Voltaire is one of many historical figures that routinely have quotes attributed to them that they never said. The quote attributed to Voltaire in the Facebook post appears to be one such example. (RELATED: Did Voltaire Say, ‘I May Disapprove Of What You Say, But I Will Defend To The Death Your Right To Say It’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched a collection of his written works, as well as his correspondence, but found nothing resembling the expression. “There are lots of quotations that are attributed to Voltaire that aren’t actually by him, and that’s one of them,” said Paul Gibbard, a professor at the University of Western Australia and one of the world’s preeminent Voltaire experts, in an interview with The Guardian. “Voltaire has been copied and imitated and pastiched ever since he produced his first writings.” The quote actually comes from a 1993 radio broadcast by Strom, but the wording varies slightly, according to etymologist Barry Popik. Strom also confirmed in a 2017 post online that it originated with him, not Voltaire. It is unclear how the saying became associated with Voltaire, Gibbard told The Guardian, though the “spirit” of the quote was “not un-Voltarian,” likely helping to spur the popular misattribution to the French philosopher and writer.

Phil Scott Vote To Impeach President Trump?,2019-10-02,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: Did Vermont Gov. Phil Scott Vote To Impeach President Trump?4:03 PM 10/02/2019Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsAn image shared on Facebook more than 5,000 times claims that Republican Vermont Gov. Phil Scott voted to impeach President Donald Trump. [Screenshot/Facebook]Verdict: False   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress can remove sitting presidents from office before their term ends after impeachment proceedings. State governors play no role in this process, so it is impossible for Scott to have voted in favor of it. Fact Check:  Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Sept. 24 that the House would initiate a formal impeachment inquiry after a member of the intelligence community filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a corruption investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. The post, which has been shared more than 5,000 times, purports that Scott, the Republican governor of Vermont, “just voted” to impeach Trump.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Hi I’m Vermont Republican Phil Scott,” reads the caption. “I just voted to impeach President Trump.” It is, however, impossible for Scott to have voted for the impeachment of the president, as state governors have no role in federal impeachment proceedings. Only Congress can remove sitting presidents from office before their term ends if enough lawmakers vote that “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors” have been committed, according to the Constitution. Article I grants the House the sole power of impeachment and makes the Senate the sole court for trying such cases.  A simple majority of the full House must vote “yes” for the president to be impeached. The Senate then votes on whether to convict the president and remove him from office following a trial overseen by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. A two-thirds majority is required for that. The Daily Caller News Foundation confirmed with Columbia Law professor Philip Bobbitt in an email that, under the process laid out explicitly in the Constitution, state governors like Scott have no role in impeachment proceedings.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Nonetheless, numerous Facebook posts have inaccurately claimed he “just voted” to impeach Trump, likely in response to Scott becoming the first Republican governor to come out in support of the impeachment inquiry in late September. “I think the inquiry is important, yes, and where it leads from here is going to be driven by the facts that are established,” he said.

Fact Check: Truman, the 33rd president, took office after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945. During his presidency, he presided over the decision to drop the atomic bomb on Japan and the end of World War II for U.S. forces.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though Truman wrote and spoke extensively on a variety of subjects, there is no evidence that the quote originated with him.

He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman. He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence that this saying originated with Francis. Fact Check: Francis, who gave up his wealth to live in evangelical poverty during the late 12th and early 13th centuries, founded the Order of Friars Minor, commonly known as the Franciscans. He is also the patron saint of the environment and animals.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While he wrote considerably on a variety of topics, the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post appears nowhere in his written works. A search of his complete writings turned up no matches. “This quotation is not found in any contemporary sources nor in any of St. Francis’s own authentic writings,” said Augustine Thompson, the theology department chair at the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “I have never heard of it before – and it does not even sound like something a thirteenth-century Italian would say. In fact, it sounds to me like something a nineteenth-century Romantic would say.” Etymologist Barry Popik traced the earliest instance of the expression in print back to 1923, where it appeared unattributed in the Boys’ Workers Round Table magazine. (It uses the word “artisan” instead of “craftsman” and “brain” instead of “head” in this instance.) It has also been attributed to lawyer Louis Nizer, who employed the quote in his 1948 book “Between You and Me,” according to Popik.

(RELATED: Did Mark Twain Say, ‘If Voting Made A Difference, They Wouldn’t Let Us Do It’?) “This anonymous joke was circulating by 1909,” writes the website Quote Investigator, “and many variations have evolved over time.” Indeed, the quote appeared in a 1909 Washington newspaper editorial, though the wording varied slightly and implied that the unattributed saying was already widely known, according to Quote Investigator. Since then, versions of the expression have also been attributed to Ernest Hemingway and Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/ayotunde.ologe/posts/10156475264846629,https://marktwainhouse.org/about/mark-twain/biography/,https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Tom-Sawyer-Mark-Twain/dp/1514682052/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=tom+sawyer&qid=1569848126&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyVEI5UzFVWlVLQ0Q3JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDg4OTQwM0g2SDVVUUkyWE1JRyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTkwMTA5MU1RMUJPOFY5TVpXWSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=,https://www.amazon.com/Adventures-Huckleberry-Finn-Mark-Twain/dp/1514637618/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=huckleberry+finn&qid=1569848139&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzM1JQSElOODlXSUJSJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDY5NzM4MlhCVTQ2REM2NUVHUCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMTY5MzI1MURNSzJMNUJPMU1TVCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=,http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/about/srchmtf.html,http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/search?keyword=%22It+takes+two+years%22&x=0&y=0&fieldList=text+date+letterno+writer+addressee+place+collection+repository+publication+publisher+title-uniform+identifier&style=mtp&brand=mtp&sort=date&category=letters,https://www.drcindylovell.com/resume,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/16/fact-check-mark-twain-voting-difference-illegal/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/09/27/quiet/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/09/27/quiet/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#097d7b6c7f667b496d686065706a6865656c7b276a6664","Did Mark Twain Say, ‘It Take Two Years To Learn To Talk, And The Rest Of Your Life To Control Your Mouth’?",,,,,

The original picture shows Thunberg posing with former Vice President Al Gore. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 160 times, used the image to suggest a connection between Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish climate activist, and Soros, a billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor. “The Manufacturing of Greta Thunberg,” reads the caption. “A Decade of Social Manipulation for the Corporate Capture of Nature. A picture is worth a thousand words.” (RELATED: Does This Picture Show Meghan Markle With George Soros’ Son?) However, a reverse image search revealed the picture has actually been doctored. Soros’s face has been superimposed over Gore’s. Thunberg shared the original picture, which captures her December 2018 meeting with the former vice president, on her Twitter and Instagram accounts.

Very few people have done more. It was an honour to meet you,” tweeted Thunberg.  The manipulated image appears to have originated from an article published satirical website called Secret News. Posted Aug. 28, the article claims Thunberg is the granddaughter of Soros and that her activism is funded by him. It is in this article that the photoshopped image appeared. Thunberg made headlines earlier in September following an impassioned speech she gave at the United Nations Climate Change Summit in New York City. She chastised world leaders for not doing enough to address climate change and emphasized the urgency of the issue.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check:  Niccolo Machiavelli was a diplomat, political philosopher and writer active during the Italian Renaissance. His book, “The Prince,” which details his political philosophy, helped establish him as an important figure in modern political theory. (RELATED: ‘I Want To Overthrow It’ — Did Machiavelli Say This Quote About The Status Quo?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though Machiavelli expounded upon a variety of political subjects, there is no evidence that he ever made this statement. Nowhere in this work, or any of his others, does the saying attributed to him in the Facebook post appear. Indeed, Princeton University politics professor Maurizio Viroli told the Daily Caller News Foundation that he had not encountered it in any of Machiavelli’s writings. “He detested and condemned fraud and deception eloquently,” said Viroli in an email. “See, for instance, Discourses on Livy, III.40. He wrote that the prince should learn to use deception or force, if necessary, but he never wrote the statement you have cited.” In “Discourses on Livy,” as Viroli pointed out, Machiavelli writes, “Although the use of fraud in every action is detestable, nonetheless in managing war it is a praiseworthy and glorious thing, and he who overcomes the enemy with fraud is praised as much as the one who overcomes it with force.” The quote may be a paraphrase of Machiavelli’s work. It also resembles a quote found in Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu’s “Art of War,” which reads, “All warfare is based on deception.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

John Philpot Curran, an Irish politician, may actually have originated the saying. Fact Check:  Jefferson made many highly quotable statements, but the saying attributed to him the Facebook post doesn’t appear to be one of them. It appears nowhere in his written works. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, ‘Most Bad Government Has Grown Out Of Too Much Government’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Furthermore, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation includes this quote, along with numerous others, on its list of spurious quotations. “This quotation was well-known in the nineteenth century,” writes his estate at Monticello, “and was in fact used by a number of famous figures, including Frederick Douglass, James Buchanan, and William Henry Harrison.” It can, according to the Monticello website, be ultimately traced back to a speech given by Curran. In the 1790 address, Curran said, “The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance; which condition if he break, servitude is at once the consequence of his crime and the punishment of his guilt.” The quote first appeared in print in 1817 but wasn’t attributed to Jefferson until at least 1834, according to his estate at Monticello.

Fact Check: Churchill has become such a popular target for fake quotes that Richard Langworth, a senior fellow at Hillsdale College’s Churchill Project, keeps a running list of sayings that he never said. (RELATED: Did Winston Churchill Say This Quote About Getting Older?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Not only does the quote about diplomacy appear on that list, but it also cannot be found anywhere in Churchill’s writings.

Quote Investigator, a website that traces the origins of widely circulated sayings, found the earliest variation of the statement published anonymously in a 1937 St. Louis newspaper, though elements of it may have appeared prior to that. The quote, shared prolifically on social media, has been attributed to Churchill since the 2000s, according Quote Investigator.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJ. J.

In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  The statement appears nowhere in Frankl’s written works. Fact Check:  Frankl was an Austrian psychiatrist who, in 1946, published the book “Man’s Search for Meaning,” in which he recounted his experiences in as a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    He wrote seven other books, but a keyword search of all these works, as well as “Man’s Search for Meaning,” turned up no matches. Franz Vesely, an archivist at the Viktor Frankl Institute, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in an email the quote was not genuine. “To put it shortly, the author Stephen R. Covey used to recount that he found the quote in a library book,” reads the Viktor Frankl Institute website, “and thought it fitting to describe Frankl’s views — but he did not note down the book’s author and title.” The statement, linked to Frankl through Covey’s summarization of his work, might actually come from psychologist Rollo May’s 1963 behavioral science article “Freedom and Responsibility Re-Examined,” though the wording varies somewhat, according to the website Quote Investigator.

No credible media sources have covered the incident. Fact Check: Patricia Harrington, an 11-year-old in Butte, Montana, shot and killed two burglars with her father’s shotgun during an attempted home invasion, according to the Facebook post. Harrington was alone when the men, allegedly illegal immigrants who had killed a man in a previous burglary, broke into her residence.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post, which has been circulating since at least 2007, uses the home invasion tale to promote anti-illegal immigrant and pro-gun political views. It also criticizes news networks, including CNN and MSNBC, for not covering the story. However, there is no evidence that this scenario ever occurred. A LexisNexis search turned up several news articles about young people stopping home invasions with firearms, including an 11-year-old boy shooting and killing burglars in South Carolina, though none matched the details in the Facebook post. Fox News nor any other major network reported the events because they never actually happened. Some local outlets in Montana did write about the home invasion, but only to debunk it. In a 2007 interview with The Montana Standard, Butte-Silver Bow Sheriff John Walsh clarified that the incident was an urban legend, adding, “It’s amazing how these things get around.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/kristy.simard.9/posts/2960656624160455,https://www.facebook.com/kristy.simard.9/posts/2960656624160455,https://www.facebook.com/kristy.simard.9/posts/2960656624160455,https://www-lexisnexis-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/hottopics/lnacademic/,https://apnews.com/7a52dc236549e227d1f915eb934be2bc,https://www.cleveland.com/morris/2013/01/the_sensational_gun_story_abou.html,https://mtstandard.com/,https://mtstandard.com/news/local/fake-story-still-circulating-on-internet/article_bc1ff1a9-cbe1-5f34-a63e-9e90b5530103.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e4a4c5b48514c7e5a5f5752475d5f52525b4c105d5153",Did An 11-Year-Old Girl Kill Two Illegal Immigrants During An Attempted Home Invasion?,,,,,

Fact Check:  Napoleon Bonaparte, a French military leader, is best known for conquering much of Europe during the early 19th century and crowning himself the first emperor of France. There is, however, no evidence that the quote attributed to Napoleon in the Facebook post originated with him. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of it in his writings.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “We cannot find a Napoleon quotation like this, nor does it seem evenly (sic) remotely credible,” said Peter Hicks of the Napoleon Foundation in an email to the DCNF. “Napoleon does not even seem to have made a remark concerning the French wars of religion 1562-98.” Furthermore, two other experts – Florida State University professor Rafe Blaufarb and Oxford University professor Michael Broers – also noted in emails to the DCNF that the language of the quotation did not match that of the time period. The origin of the expression is unknown, but it has been circulating since at least 1999.

Verdict: False No credible sources link this statement to Rooney. Much of it originally came from an article by sports writer Nick Gholson for a Texas newspaper in 1999. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Rooney, a news commentator, was known for his segment “A Few Minutes with Andy Rooney” on the CBS program “60 Minutes.” (RELATED: ‘We Are One Election Away From Open Borders, Socialism, Gun Confiscation’ – Did Tim Allen Make This Statement?) This Facebook post alleges that Rooney authored a long statement that defends Christians’ right to prayer and criticizes those who ban it from public events like football games. It’s paired with an image of his likeness. However, there is no evidence that Rooney ever wrote or said anything to that effect. No credible sources link him to the statement online, and it doesn’t appear in any of his writings. Rooney has made his views on religion very clear, from poking fun at organized religion in editorials to identifying himself as non-religious in public appearances. During a talk at Tufts University in 2004, Rooney told the crowd that he was an atheist.  “I don’t understand religion at all,” said Rooney. “I’m sure I’ll offend a lot of people by saying this, but I think it’s all nonsense.” The original statement, tracked down by Snopes in 2004, was written in 1999 by Gholson and later republished in the Laurel Leader Call newspaper. It appears that parts of Gholson’s statement have been cut, and lines from another source have been added to form the full statement attributed to Rooney in the Facebook post.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Further adding to the dubiousness of the attribution, one line references events of “2019/2020,” though Rooney passed away in 2011.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/susanfdonovan001/posts/10219864870802018,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andy-Rooney,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/11/fact-check-viral-tim-allen-statement-attacking-democrats/,https://www.facebook.com/susanfdonovan001/posts/10219864870802018,https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00045/cah-00045.html,https://web.archive.org/web/20040409105629/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4355043/,https://tuftsdaily.com/archives/2004/11/19/rooney-offers-his-opinion/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/in-defense-of-prayer/,https://newspaperarchive.com/laurel-leader-call-sep-20-2000-p-15/,https://www.facebook.com/susanfdonovan001/posts/10219864870802018,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec989e899a839eac888d8580958f8d8080899ec28f8381",Did Andy Rooney Make This Statement Defending Prayer?,,,,,

Fact Check: This quote, shared frequently on conservative Facebook pages, is sometimes prefaced with the sentence, “If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Jefferson did write that in a letter he penned in 1816, but there is no evidence that he authored the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. A search of the “Papers of Thomas Jefferson” returned no matches, and it doesn’t appear in a collection of his quotes and letters. Furthermore, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, which maintains his estate at Monticello, categorizes it as a “spurious quotation.” Monticello cites Reagan’s speech for National Library Week in 1981 as the likely source for the misattributed saying. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, ‘Dissent Is The Highest Form Of Patriotism’?) “If we are to guard against ignorance and remain free, as Jefferson cautioned, it is the responsibility of every American to be informed,” said the 40th president in the speech. “Reagan does not specifically attribute this wording to Jefferson,” reads the Monticello website, “so we believe that Reagan’s paraphrase has become mistaken for Jefferson’s exact words.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/dennisLschebig.90/posts/487177518730810,https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=662373584221589&id=536593673466248,https://www.facebook.com/trinitycorepublicanwomen/posts/2217827125134698,https://founders.archives.gov/?q=%22in%20a%20state%20of%20civilization%22&s=1111311111&sa=&r=4&sr=,https://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/default.xqy?keys=TSJN-search-1&mode=TOC,http://tjrs.monticello.org/archive/search/all?keys=%22guard+against+ignorance%22&sort_bef_combine=field_tjrs_date_value+ASC&field_tjrs_date_value_1%5Bvalue%5D%5Bdate%5D=&field_tjrs_date_value2_1%5Bvalue%5D%5Bdate%5D=,https://www.monticello.org/thomas-jefferson-foundation/,https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/if-we-are-guard-against-ignorance-spurious-quotation,https://books.google.com/books?id=IFAg-kIAI0AC&pg=PA87&dq=%22%22If+we+are+to+guard+against+ignorance+and+remain+free,+it+is+the+responsibility+of+every+American+to+be+informed%22+1981+national+library+week&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjq6fr_mOzkAhWBtlkKHWZiBJIQ6AEwBHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22If%20we%20are%20to%20guard%20against%20ignorance%20and%20remain%20free%2C%20as%20Jefferson%20cautioned%2C%20it%20is%20the%20responsibility%20of%20every%20American%20to%20be%20informed.%22&f=false,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/18/fact-check-thomas-jefferson-dissent-highest-form-patriotism/,https://books.google.com/books?id=IFAg-kIAI0AC&pg=PA87&dq=%22%22If+we+are+to+guard+against+ignorance+and+remain+free,+it+is+the+responsibility+of+every+American+to+be+informed%22+1981+national+library+week&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjq6fr_mOzkAhWBtlkKHWZiBJIQ6AEwBHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22If%20we%20are%20to%20guard%20against%20ignorance%20and%20remain%20free%2C%20as%20Jefferson%20cautioned%2C%20it%20is%20the%20responsibility%20of%20every%20American%20to%20be%20informed.%22&f=false,https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/if-we-are-guard-against-ignorance-spurious-quotation,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b5c1c7d0c3dac7f5d1d4dcd9ccd6d4d9d9d0c79bd6dad8","Did Thomas Jefferson Say, ‘It Is The Responsibility Of Every American To Be Informed’?",,,,,

The video and website it was posted on have no apparent affiliation with CNN. Fact Check: The video, which prompted much speculation on social media and garnered more than 635,000 views on YouTube, masquerades as content from CNN, with the video caption saying, “The Actor, Filmmaker, Musician, and Politician Dies Of Heart Attack At 89. He Was Filming A Commercial.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the video did not actually come from CNN. It has not been posted on CNN’s website nor the network’s social media accounts. The website linked in the Facebook post also has no apparent affiliation with the cable news network. The video’s claim that Eastwood, known for roles in films like “Dirty Harry” and “Million Dollar Baby,” has died from a heart attack while shooting a television commercial doesn’t hold up either. If Eastwood had passed away, it would have been reported by the media, yet no credible news outlets have picked up the story. Eastwood’s family has not issued a press release. This is not the first time that Eastwood has been the target of a celebrity death hoax.

Fact Check: Widely considered the founder of the Democratic Party, Jackson served as the seventh U.S. president. Before being elected to the Oval Office, he had a successful military career.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While the internet is replete with quotes attributed to Jackson, this particular expression appears to be apocryphal. There is no record of it in his writings. Daniel Feller, the director of The Papers of Andrew Jackson at the University of Tennessee, debunked the quote in a 2007 article published in The Los Angeles Times. “Here at The Papers of Andrew Jackson at the University of Tennessee, we collect and publish copies of every authenticated Jackson writing and utterance,” wrote Feller. “We have nothing to corroborate his authorship of this line.” The misattribution likely stems from usage of a slight variation of the quote in James Parton’s 1860 three-volume biography titled “Life of Andrew Jackson,” according to Feller. The saying – “desperate courage makes one a majority” – appears on the title page of each volume in quotation marks.  However, there is no indication that Parton intended the expression to be interpreted as Jackson’s words. It was actually meant as a criticism of the seventh president because Parton, according to Feller, thought Jackson was a “headstrong ignoramus whose desperate courage overrode other men’s good sense.” “Parton did not mean it as a compliment, and Jackson, were he alive to see it, certainly would not have taken it as such,” Feller said in the 2007 article.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The Daily Caller News Foundation reached out to two other experts, neither of whom thought the saying came from Jackson. H.W. Brands, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, also noted in an email to the DCNF that it did not sound like Jackson. The origin of the saying is unknown but similar expressions have been found in the works of transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau and abolitionist Wendell Phillips.  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check:  Widely considered one of the greatest playwrights of all time, Shakespeare wrote at least 37 plays, as well as numerous sonnets and poems. The popularity of his work, much of which is still read today, has resulted in him being frequently credited with quotes, genuine and apocryphal.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Folger Shakespeare Library puts this saying about heartache in the latter category, listing the quote as “commonly misattributed” on its website. (RELATED: Did Shakespeare Say, ‘The Earth Has Music For Those Who Listen’?) The Daily Caller News Foundation searched the Shakespeare Quartos Archive, an online database of all his plays, as well his collected poetry, but found no record of the statement in either. According to the Folger Shakespeare Library, the only instance of Shakespeare using the word “heartache” (spelled “heart-ache”) appears in the titular character’s “To be, or not to be” soliloquy in “Hamlet.” Paul Bruda, author of “Shakespeare Early and Late: A Textbook,” also confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the quote did not belong to Shakespeare.

Facebook/Screenshot “Area 51 right now,” reads the caption.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The mis-captioned photograph actually depicts attendees of a 2014 religious event in South Africa. Fact Check: Area 51, which is the colloquial name for the classified Air Force facility in the Nevada Test and Training Range, is central to numerous conspiracy theories about aliens and UFOs. (RELATED: Does The US Have The Most Military Satellites In Space?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In June, college student Matty Roberts created the Facebook event “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop Us All,” which jokingly called for the public invasion of Area 51 in search of extraterrestrial lifeforms. The event also spawned festivals in the nearby towns of Rachel and Hiko. Of the more than 2 million people who, according to the Washington Post, signed up to attend the event, only about 100 people showed up at the border of the military facility in the early morning of Sept. 20. At least two people were detained by local law enforcement. However, the viral image does not show the crowd outside Area 51. A reverse image search reveals that the picture, found on the In His Name Ministries website, actually depicts attendees at 2014 “crusade” in Nkomazi, South Africa, according to the post. The international Christian evangelical organization holds several open-air events like the one in the mis-captioned picture each year.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=133138991308715&set=gm.2423563614359042&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=133138991308715&set=gm.2423563614359042&type=3&theater,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/18/politics/navy-confirms-ufo-videos-trnd/index.html,https://www.insider.com/area-51s-history-and-conspiracy-theories-over-the-years-2019-7,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/08/18/fact-check-us-most-military-satellites-space/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/12/he-got-million-people-say-theyd-storm-area-now-hes-planning-an-alien-festival/,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/09/22/area-51-festival-wraps-up-earthlings-head-home/23817608/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/12/he-got-million-people-say-theyd-storm-area-now-hes-planning-an-alien-festival/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/20/storm-area-51-facebook-event-draws-only-100-people/2388810001/,https://abc7news.com/5555439/,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=133138991308715&set=gm.2423563614359042&type=3&theater,https://www.inhisname.global/about/,http://www.inhisname.org.za/in-his-service/crusade-report-nkomazi/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9de9eff8ebf2efddf9fcf4f1e4fefcf1f1f8efb3fef2f0",Does This Photo Show The Crowd At The ‘Storm Area 51’ Event?,,,,,

Beto O’Rourke has a criminal record that prevents him from purchasing firearms.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “That burglary and DWI will get you every time,” reads the caption. Verdict: False O’Rourke was arrested for two misdemeanors in the 1990s, but both charges were dropped. Because neither was a felony or domestic violence misdemeanor, and he was not even convicted in either instance, he is legally eligible to purchase a firearm. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    O’Rourke, a Democratic presidential candidate, made headlines when he called for the mandatory buyback of assault weapons during the third Democratic primary debate on Sept. 12. This comes after a mass shooting at a Walmart in O’Rourke’s hometown of El Paso, Texas, left 22 people dead. “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” said O’Rourke during the debate. “We’re not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.” The viral Facebook post, which has been shared more than 800 times, suggests that O’Rourke wants to “confiscate guns” because his alleged criminal record prevents him from purchasing a firearm himself. A background check on LexisNexis, a legal research platform, reveals that O’Rourke has been arrested twice – once for an unnamed misdemeanor in 1995 and once for driving while intoxicated in 1998.  His first arrest was for, as he explains in his own words, “attempted forcible entry after jumping a fence at the University of Texas at El Paso.” This misdemeanor charge, which fell under the burglary section of the state penal code, was later declined, according to county records. Three years later, in 1998, O’Rourke got arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated in a town outside of El Paso, Texas. The arrest report obtained by the Houston Chronicle states that a witness saw O’Rourke lose control of his car, hit another vehicle and try to leave the scene of the accident. His blood alcohol levels were 0.136 and 0.134, above 0.10, the state’s legal limit at the time.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The charge for driving while intoxicated was dropped after O’Rourke completed a court-ordered diversion program, according to the Houston Chronicle. “As the cases were dismissed they should not keep him from buying a firearm in Texas,” said Russ Hunt Jr., a Texas-based criminal defense lawyer, in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Mere arrests that resulted in dismissals, whether felony or misdemeanors, don’t disqualify a prospective purchaser.” Indeed, O’Rourke was and still is able to purchase guns, as he meets both federal and state eligibility requirements. Under state laws in Texas, a person does not have to obtain a license or permit to buy a firearm, but he or she must be at least 18 years old to purchase a rifle and 21 years old to buy a handgun. Federal law also requires licensed gun dealers to conduct a background check prior to a gun purchase, unless the person already has a license to carry. (Background checks are not required for private sales.) Both federal and state law, however, prohibit a person who has been convicted of a felony or a domestic violence misdemeanor from purchasing and possessing firearms. Some people with a history of mental illness may also be ineligible, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. O’Rourke told the Associated Press in a March interview that he had inherited guns from his great uncle and knew how to shoot.

The poem, inspired by the abolitionist of the same name, was published in 1889 as part of his “Rhymes of Ironquill” poetry collection.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/petechapmanmarketing/photos/a.1893167310967119/2471097939840717/?type=3&theater,https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/eugene-ware/16536,https://www.biography.com/writer/william-shakespeare,https://books.google.com/books?id=FlTodHxrFvEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=romeo+and+juliet&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjz0au3_enkAhWM2FkKHQ-KDE8Q6AEwAnoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=%22daring%20to%20begin%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=P0CehDJM6c4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+midsummer+night%27s+dream&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiw-P_J_enkAhXws1kKHcXPDyUQ6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22daring%20to%20begin%22&f=false,http://www.quartos.org/main.php,https://books.google.com/books?id=GoY8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+complete+poems+of+william+shakespeare&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiwqJGOl_7jAhXrT98KHZupAJ4Q6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=%22The%20earth%20has%20music%20for%20those%20who%20listen%22&f=false,https://shakespeareandbeyond.folger.edu/2017/02/21/shakepeare-quotes-commonly-misattributed/,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/03/fact-check-shakespeare-earth-music-those-listen/,https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/eugene-ware/16536,https://shakespeareandbeyond.folger.edu/2017/02/21/shakepeare-quotes-commonly-misattributed/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Brown-American-abolitionist,https://books.google.com/books?id=j-JEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA77&dq=%22john+brown%22+eugene+ware&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiOnb7mlujkAhXGc98KHSaSAKMQ6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=%22All%20glory%20comes%20from%20daring%20to%20begin%22&f=false,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b5c1c7d0c3dac7f5d1d4dcd9ccd6d4d9d9d0c79bd6dad8","Did Shakespeare Say, ‘All Glory Comes From Daring To Begin’?",,,,,

It may actually be a line from a 1954 high school graduation speaker. Fact Check: A student of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, Aristotle lived in the 4th century B.C. His best known works include treatises like “Nicomachean Ethics,” and “Metaphysics,” both classics of philosophical literature.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though Aristotle wrote extensively on a wide range of topics, there is no evidence that he originated the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. It appears nowhere in his writings. The Daily Caller also reached out to several experts, none of whom believed the expression was genuine. (RELATED: Did Plato Say ‘Only The Dead Have Seen The End Of War’?) “This is not a quote from Aristotle,” confirmed Richard Kraut, a philosophy professor at Northwestern University, in an email to the Caller. Another expert, Alan Code of Stanford University Department of Philosophy, also noted in an email to the Caller, “Aristotle’s God does not think about us.”  The website Quote Investigator “provisionally” credits religious scholar Marcus Bach with crafting the expression. “The ascription to Aristotle is unsupported,” writes Quote Investigator. “Marcus Bach used versions of the expression in speeches multiple times beginning in 1954. Some of Bach’s listeners thought that Bach was attributing the words to Albert Schweitzer.” Indeed, he has employed the words since at least 1954, where he used them in an Iowa high school graduation speech. Several years later, a newspaper reported that Bach attributed the words to Nobel Peace Prize winner Albert Schweitzer in another speech. Quote Investigator believes this attribution to be erroneous, though, as Bach used the saying in earlier speeches without attributing it to another source and later included it in his 1971 book.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jdr4401/posts/312675726071481,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aristotle,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Plato,https://www.amazon.com/Nicomachean-Ethics-Aristotle/dp/1463536275,https://www.amazon.com/Metaphysics-Great-Books-Philosophy/dp/0879756713,https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Works-Aristotle-Translation-Bollingen/dp/0691099502,https://oll.libertyfund.org/search/advanced?q=%22place+where+your+talent+meets%22&author%5Bhistorical_period%5D=&author%5Bschool_of_thought%5D=&author%5Bnationality%5D=&title%5Bhistorical_period%5D=&title%5Bsubject_area%5D=&title%5Btopic%5D=,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/09/fact-check-plato-only-dead-seen-end-war-macarthur/,https://www.philosophy.northwestern.edu/people/continuing-faculty/kraut-richard.html,https://philosophy.stanford.edu/people/alan-d-code,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/12/20/talent/#note-17584-1,https://www.newspapers.com/image/344959/,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1952/schweitzer/biographical/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/12/20/talent/#note-17584-1,https://www.newspapers.com/image/344959/,https://www.amazon.com/Power-Perfect-Liberty-Marcus-Bach/dp/0136868320,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8afef8effce5f8caeeebe3e6f3e9ebe6e6eff8a4e9e5e7",‘The Place Where Your Talent Meets The World’s Need’ – Did Aristotle Say This Quote About Jobs?,,,,,

Elizabeth Warren said, “If Republicans disarm, all is well and good. If they refuse to disarm, we shall disarm them ourselves.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Warren ever making this statement. Fact Check: Warren, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, announced her 2020 presidential bid in February 2019. (RELATED: ‘That’s Just Human Nature’ – Did Dianne Feinstein Say This Quote About Gun Control?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Months later, in August, she unveiled her gun control plan ahead of the third Democratic primary debate. Her plan, which proposes measures like universal background checks and an assault weapons ban, aims to reduce gun violence by 80 percent. There is no gun buyback plan included in her proposal, though other candidates like former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke have called for such action. Yet, while her campaign platform does include gun control measures, there is no evidence that Warren said the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post. It doesn’t appear on her Twitter accounts or in ProPublica’s archive of her deleted tweets. A search of the congressional record didn’t yield any results either. The alleged quote, debunked by Snopes in 2016, bears some resemblance to a statement made by Joseph Stalin, a leader of the Soviet Union. According to the Marxist Internet Archive, Stalin employed similar words during a 1927 speech, saying, “If the opposition disarms – well and good. If it refuses to disarm – we shall disarm it ourselves.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2401347709877457&set=a.161953947150189&type=3&theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/05/31/fact-check-dianne-feinstein-gunman-lay-down-weapons-human-nature/,https://medium.com/@teamwarren/protecting-our-communities-from-gun-violence-a2ebf7abd9be,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/13/winners-losers-third-democratic-debate/,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/16/beto-orourke-buyback-gun-1466128,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%22Republicans%20disarm%22%22%20(from%3Aewarren)&src=typed_query,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%22Republicans%20disarm%22%22%20(from%3ASenWarren)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/SenWarren?page=1,https://www.congress.gov/search?q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22congrecord%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22If%20Republicans%20disarm%2C%20all%20is%20well%20and%20good.%20If%20they%20refuse%20to%20disarm%2C%20we%20shall%20disarm%20them%20ourselves%5C%22%22%7D&searchResultViewType=expanded,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/warren-disarm-them-ourselves/,https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1927/12/02.htm,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#92e6e0f7e4fde0d2f6f3fbfeebf1f3fefef7e0bcf1fdff",Does Elizabeth Warren Want To Take Guns Away From Republicans?,,,,,

It actually comes from a character in former gymnast Dan Millman’s book. Fact Check:  Born in Athens, Greece, around 470 B.C., Socrates pioneered the “Socratic Method” of question-and-answer-based dialogue and taught historically significant philosophical figures like Plato and Xenophon. He is widely considered a foundational figure in Western philosophy. (RELATED: Did Plato Say, ‘Only The Dead Have Seen The End Of War’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Socrates wrote nothing so everything we think he ‘said’ is always attributed to him by another source: Plato, Xenophon, Aristophanes, et cetera,” said University of Michigan professor and Socrates expert Sara Ahbel-Rappe in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. However, neither Plato nor Xenophon attribute the expression to Socrates in their works. It appears nowhere in Plato’s “The Socratic Dialogues” or Xenophon’s “Conversations with Socrates.” “I can definitely say that no ancient source ever attributed anything like this statement to Socrates,” said Ahbel-Rappe. “Socrates was not interested in change at all, at least in the sense of fomenting political change. Nor did he concern himself with political fights, but only with the revolution within.” The quote actually originated in former gymnast Millman’s 1980 fictionalized memoir “Way of the Peaceful Warrior,” in which a character nicknamed Socrates offered the saying as a piece of advice, according to the website Quote Investigator.  “You have many habits that weaken you,” said the character. “The secret of change is to focus all your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new.” (The wording varies slightly in later versions of the book.) “The reassignment of the quotation to the Greek luminary was, no doubt, facilitated by confusion between the matching names,” wrote Quote Investigator. “This is a known mechanism for misattribution.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  White House adviser and first daughter Ivanka Trump shared the misattributed quote on Twitter in 2018. She later deleted it and tweeted the quote again, noting it came from the fictional character.

Fact Check:  A member of the Marx Brothers comedy act, Julius “Groucho” Marx had a successful entertainment career that spanned nearly 70 years. His work, which ranged from vaudeville to film, often featured his iconic greasepaint mustache, spectacles and cigar.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While Marx coined numerous maxims and witticisms, there is no evidence that the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post is one of those. The saying doesn’t appear in his collected writings or his correspondence. Searching his autobiographies didn’t return any results either. Etymologist Barry Popik traced the statement back to a 1930 Massachusetts newspaper where, according to his website, British publisher and writer Ernest Benn is quoted as saying the expression, though the wording varies slightly. The quote can also be found, attributed to Benn, in Henry Powell Spring’s 1944 book “What is Truth.” The earliest instance of Marx being credited with the expression occurred in a 1964 issue of the Kentucky New Era newspaper, according to Popik.

J. Cahill | Contributor share on facebook tweet this show commentsAn image shared on Facebook purportedly shows then-President Ronald Reagan meeting with Taliban leaders in the Oval Office.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The photo actually shows Reagan meeting with Afghan mujahedeen in 1983, approximately a decade before the Taliban formed. Fact Check: This image, which has been circulating on social media since at least 2016, was shared on Facebook after President Donald Trump announced that he had called off talks with Taliban leaders just days before the 18th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Reagan sits in the Oval Office with a group of men wearing turbans in the picture. “NeverTrumpers: A President meeting with the Taliban,” reads the caption. “This is horrific!” However, a reverse image search reveals that the photograph does not depict Reagan meeting with the Taliban. The picture, which the Daily Caller found on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library website, actually shows the president meeting with “Afghan Freedom Fighters” to discuss “Soviet atrocities in Afghanistan,” according to its caption. The men, also referred to as mujahedeen, were Islamic guerrilla fighters who opposed the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan during the 70s and 80s. The Reagan administration provided funds to aid their resistance efforts. Adding even more to the Facebook post’s dubiousness, the photograph was taken in 1983, according to its caption, so it is impossible for the men who met with Reagan to be Taliban members. The Taliban didn’t emerge until the mid-90s, roughly a decade after the picture was taken.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJ. J.

Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won’t come in.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  There is no evidence that Asimov ever said or wrote this statement. It might actually come from a commencement address given by “M*A*S*H” actor Alan Alda. Fact Check:  A prolific science fiction and popular science writer, Asimov wrote nearly 500 books over his lifetime. He is best known for his science fiction novels, including the “Foundation” series and “I, Robot.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of the quote attributed to Asimov in the Facebook post in his written works. A search of Boston University’s comprehensive Asimov manuscript collection didn’t turn up anything resembling the expression either. “Alan Alda should receive credit for the words he spoke in 1980,” states the website Quote Investigator. “Based on current evidence the attribution to Isaac Asimov is spurious.” Alda, an actor best known for his role as Capt. Benjamin Franklin “Hawkeye” Pierce in the popular television series “M*A*S*H,” said the statement during a commencement speech at Connecticut College in 1980, according to Quote Investigator. It has been attributed to Asimov since at least 2002, though it’s unclear how the statement first got linked to him. The Oxford Essential Quotations also ascribes the saying to Alda, noting that it is often misattributed to Asimov.

Both lithium mining and oil sands extraction harm the environment but their processes are too different for an apples-to-apples comparison. Fact Check: This Facebook post contrasts the picture of a large open-air lithium mine with one of a small oil sands extraction site, suggesting that mining for the lithium used in some electric car batteries harms the environment more than extracting fossil fuels.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “This is a mine where lithium is extracted for electric car batteries,” reads the caption. “This is an oilsands (sic) site in Alberta. Tell me more about how your electric car is better for the environment.” (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Tweet About Electric Cars During Hurricane Dorian?) A reverse image search revealed that the top photograph does not depict a lithium mining operation but rather the world’s largest copper mine. Located in Chile, the Escondida mine produced more than 1.2 million tons of copper last year, according to Mining Journal. Though some lithium comes from ore mining, the more common production method is extracting it from brine reservoirs beneath salt flats, according to a 2018 study. That process entails pumping salt-rich water to the surface into evaporation ponds, where it undergoes solar evaporation over an extended period, and removing all metals other than lithium. It is important to note that both extraction methods have harmful effects on the environment.  Unlike the top picture in the Facebook post, the second one does, in fact, show what it claims: an oil sands extraction rig that’s part of MEG Energy‘s Christina Lake in-situ oil sands operation in Alberta. (In-situ extraction occurs when the bitumen deposits are too deep in the earth to access via surface mining.) The Christina Lake site uses a technique called steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) to recover bitumen. SAGD, the primary method of extraction in such extraction sites, uses steam continuously pumped through underground wells to bring fluid bitumen to the surface.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “Oilsands (sic) production via SAGD has little surface impact compared to mining,” Steven Bryant, a professor in the University of Calgary’s chemical and petroleum engineering department, told the Daily Caller in an email. That isn’t to say it doesn’t negatively impact the environment. A joint study by the Pembina Institute and Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society argues that it can be more damaging than surfacing mining, in terms of deforestation and the resulting wildlife loss. An “apples-to-apples” comparison of environmental impact would, according to Stevens, not weigh the negative effects of lithium mining against in-situ oil sands extraction. Instead, it would look at lithium mining and oil sands mining, which effect the land equally, Nexant’s Energy and Chemicals Advisory analyst Daniel Saxton told the Caller in an email. “Production of the energy material is, however, only one part of the overall environmental impact,” said Bryant in an email to the Caller. “The use or consumption of the material also contributes, as does its mode of distribution.” “A full accounting would also consider the [greenhouse gas] emissions associated with electric vehicle production and operation – especially the fuel used to produce the electricity – vs the GHG emissions associated with oil production and consumption in internal combustion engines,” Bryant added.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/2atees1/photos/a.867280693463135/1201883156669552/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/2atees1/photos/a.867280693463135/1201883156669552/?type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/06/fact-check-ocasio-cortez-tweet-electric-cars-hurricane-dorian/,https://www.mining.com/featured-article/ranked-worlds-top-copper-mines/,https://www.bhp.com/media-and-insights/image-gallery/locations-and-operations/escondida-chile,https://www.mining-journal.com/static/about,https://www.thebalance.com/lithium-production-2340123,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718318746,http://samcotech.com/what-is-lithium-extraction-and-how-does-it-work/,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesellsmoor/2019/06/10/electric-vehicles-are-driving-demand-for-lithium-with-environmental-consequences/#1bf3919362e2,https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lithium-batteries-environment-impact,https://www.aer.ca/documents/oilsands/insitu-presentations/2018MEGChristinaLakeSAGD10773.pdf,https://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/technical/in-situ,https://www.britannica.com/science/bitumen,https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/energy-sources-distribution/crude-oil/oil-sands-extraction-and-processing/18094,https://www.ucalgary.ca/research/scholars/bryant-steven,https://www.pembina.org/reports/1000-cuts.pdf,https://www.nexant.com/about/leadership/daniel-saxton,https://www.ucalgary.ca/research/scholars/bryant-steven,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#21555344574e53614540484d5842404d4d44530f424e4c",Do These Images Show The Differences Between The Environmental Impact Of Lithium Mining And Oil Sands Extraction?,,,,,

You Have A Body’?",2019-09-18,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: Did C.S. Lewis Say, ‘You Do Not Have A Soul. You Are A Soul. You Have A Body’?2:31 PM 09/18/2019Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsA post shared on Facebook alleges that Christian apologist C.S. Lewis once said, “You do not have a soul. You are a soul. You have a body.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  This saying does not appear anywhere in C.S. Lewis’s collected works. Fact Check:  C.S. Lewis, widely regarded as an influential 20th century writer and theologian, is perhaps best known for his fantasy novel series “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which has since been adapted for the big screen. He also wrote extensively about religious matters in works like “The Problem of Pain” and “Reflections on the Psalms.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in his writings or “The Quotable Lewis,” a book that contains more than 1,500 verified quotes, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to Lewis in the Facebook post. The C.S. Lewis Foundation includes the saying on a section of its website labeled “Quotes Misattributed to C.S. Lewis.” The DCNF reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the expression originated with Lewis. Other experts, like “The Misquotable C.S. Lewis” author William O’Flaherty, have also debunked it online. The quote may actually originate with Scottish author and minister George MacDonald, according to O’Flaherty. In his 1867 book “Annals of a Quiet Neighborhood,” MacDonald wrote a similar expression, “They ought to be taught that they have bodies; and that their bodies die; while they themselves live on … that we talk as if we POSSESSED souls, instead of BEING souls.” A monthly journal called “The British Friend” later attributed a shorter version of the quote to MacDonald in an 1892 article. That truncated version, O’Flaherty theorizes, was subsequently associated with Lewis, who enjoyed MacDonald’s work.  Yet, while there is no evidence that Lewis coined the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post, he did discuss the relationship between the soul and the body in his writing. In “Letters to Malcolm,” for example, Lewis wrote, “At present we tend to think of the soul as somehow ‘inside’ the body. But the glorified body of the resurrection as I conceive it – the sensuous life raised from its death – will be inside the soul.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: The meme, which has been circulating on social media since at least last week, displays a photograph and the full name of a police officer. “Police were called to a Chicago gym after a teen kept sneaking in,” reads the caption. “Instead of arresting him, Officer Mario Valenti shot him 53 times.” (Note that the font completely changes in the last four words.)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While it does, in fact, correctly identify Valenti, then a police officer at the Skokie Police Department in Illinois, the Facebook post gets the officer’s response to catching the teenager sneaking into a Chicago gym very wrong. A quick internet search reveals that, in August 2017, Valenti actually offered $150 out of his own pocket to buy the teenager a new gym membership – not shoot him 53 times, as the image claims. (RELATED: Was A Police Officer Assaulted Every 9 Minutes In 2016?) Vincent Gonzales, a Chicago teenager, started sneaking into XSport Fitness to play basketball after his mother could no longer afford to pay for his membership, according to the Chicago Tribune. Gym management repeatedly warned Gonzales against sneaking in and eventually had to call the police. “I just want to play basketball,” Gonzalez, a highly-ranked high school basketball player who hoped to go pro, said at the time, according to NBC 5 Chicago. “I’ve been sneaking in there a lot, for a long time.”  Valenti responded to the call from the fitness facility and, instead of arresting Gonzales for criminal trespassing, offered to pay for his gym membership.

Fact Check:  François-Marie Arouet, better known by the pen name Voltaire, was a French writer and philosopher during the 18th century Enlightenment movement. His works, often filled with wit and satire, discussed many themes, including civil liberties and freedom of speech.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though the quote may reflect his views on freedom of speech, there is no evidence that Voltaire authored it. A search of his written works and correspondence returned nothing resembling the expression. The Daily Caller News Foundation also reached out to several experts, all of whom said the expression originated with Hall. “The quote is widely attributed to Voltaire but actually it was created by Evelyn Beatrice Hall, a biographer of Voltaire, who gave it as an example of Voltaire’s thinking,” City University of New York professor Marvin Carlson said in an email to the DCNF. Indeed, the earliest instance of the quote occurs in Hall’s 1906 “The Friends of Voltaire,” a biography of the French writer and philosopher originally published under Hall’s pseudonym S.G. Tallentyre.  In the passage where the quote appears, Hall discusses Voltaire’s reaction to news that the government had condemned and burned fellow French philosopher Claude-Adrien Helvétius’ book. Voltaire, according to Hall, did not find the substance of Helvétius’ work particularly impressive but was still dismayed by French Parliament’s actions. “‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it,’ was his attitude now,” wrote Hall.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  She later clarified in a 1939 letter that, despite this phrase being in quotation marks, they were not Voltaire’s words, insisting, “The phrase … is my own expression.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Yet, unlike others, there’s clear evidence that Lincoln actually said them. However, the same cannot be said for the quote attributed to Lincoln in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched Lincoln’s writings, as well as his recorded speeches, but found nothing matching the statement. (RELATED: Did Abraham Lincoln Say, ‘To Sin By Silence When They Should Protest, Makes Cowards Of Men’?) “I can find no evidence that Lincoln having [sic] said or written this,” said Daniel Worthington, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln, in an email to the DCNF. “No doubt a mis-attribution.” James Cornelius, an editor and secretary at the Abraham Lincoln Association, agreed that the quote wasn’t authentic, writing in an email to the DCNF, “This one is not Lincoln at all.”  The Abraham Lincoln Association debunked the quote in a 2003 newsletter. The article notes that, according to “A Dictionary of Americanisms,” the word “hustle” meant “to get up” or “obtain” during Lincoln’s lifetime, instead of being a colloquialism for hard work, as it can be used today.

A search of his complete literary works, as well as his correspondence, turned up no matching or similar phrases. Robert Hirst, curator of the Mark Twain Papers at the University of California, Berkley, told FactCheck.org that the quote was “absolutely not” accurate. “It’s also out of character – he voted often, and involved himself as a citizen in politics in a number of issues,” said Steve Courtney, the curatorial special projects coordinator for the Mark Twain House and Museum, in an email to the Caller. “In this country we have one great privilege which they don’t have in other countries,” Twain once said on the issue of voting. “When a thing gets to be absolutely unbearable the people can rise up and throw it off. That’s the finest asset we’ve got – the ballet box.”  A variation of the statement appeared unattributed in a 1976 column published in the Lowell Sun periodical, though elements of the expression may have appeared earlier.

It may actually have been penned by British statesman Oliver Cromwell in a 1650 letter.

(RELATED: Did Benjamin Franklin Say, ‘Tell Me And I Forget, Teach Me And I May Remember, Involve Me And I Learn’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    His estate at Mount Vernon has received so many inquiries over the years about quotes attributed to the nation’s first president that they now keep a running list of “spurious quotations.” An internet search revealed that this specific expression appears on that list. “The library verified that this quote was not from George Washington,” writes his Mount Vernon Estate, “though [it] has not [been] able to trace its actual origins.” Indeed, there is no evidence that Washington ever made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller found it nowhere in his written works or recorded speeches. The expression may actually come from a 1650 letter written by Cromwell to Sir Walter Dundas, who was the governor of Edinburgh Castle at the time. A 17th century British statesman and military leader, Cromwell led the parliamentary forces against the monarchy during the English Civil War and later ruled the Commonwealth as lord protector.  “It will be found an unjust and unwise jealousy, to deprive a man of his natural liberty upon a supposition he may abuse it,” wrote Cromwell. “When he doth abuse it, judge.

Fact Check:  Forster, a British writer and literary critic, wrote prolifically during his lifetime, amassing a large body of work. He is perhaps best known for his books “Howards End,” “A Passage to India” and “A Room with a View.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the expression appears nowhere in these works or any of his others. A search of the Papers of Edward Morgan Forster at the King’s College Archives yielded no similar or matching phrases either. The collection, which Forster bequeathed to King’s College in 1970, contains many of his novels, short stories, essays, plays and poems. The DCNF also reached out to a number of experts, none of whom recognized the quotation. “It does not sound to me like Forster in his novels, anyway, although the idea is Forster-like,” Krzysztof Fordonski, chairman of the International E.M. Forster Society, said in an email to the DCNF. The saying may actually come from Joseph Campbell, an American professor and author known for his work in comparative mythology, according to the website Quote Investigator. In her 1991 book “Reflections on the Art of Living: A Joseph Campbell Companion,” Diane Osbon quoted Campbell as having said the statement attributed to Forster in the Facebook post, though the wording differed slightly.

That’s why certain people appear bright until you hear them speak.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The statement appears nowhere in Einstein’s written works. Fact Check: Einstein famously put forward, along with other important contributions to the field of physics, the theory of special relativity, which suggests that objects can approach but not exceed the speed of light. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say That Technology Would Create A ‘Generation Of Idiots’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While the theoretical physicist did discuss the speed of light in his writings, there is no evidence that Einstein authored this specific saying. A search of the Einstein Archive Online returned no results. It also doesn’t appear in Alice Calaprice’s “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein,” which contains more than 1,000 verified sayings and quips from Einstein. The earliest close match to the statement dates back to 1989, where it was published in a Delaware newsletter as part of a list of quips, according to the website Quote Investigator. It’s unclear, however, whether it originated with Robert Orben or Gary Apple, who both served as editor of the newsletter, or another source altogether. Einstein has been credited with coining the saying since at least 2009, according to Quote Investigator.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/margaret.burke.10/posts/2226730960757824,https://www.space.com/17661-theory-general-relativity.html,https://www.space.com/36273-theory-special-relativity.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/what-can-travel-faster-than-the-speed-of-light-2015-2,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/04/30/fact-check-einstein-technology-generation-idiots/,http://www.alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Search/Results?lookfor=We+all+know+that+light+travels+faster+than+sound.+That%27s+why+certain+people+appear+bright+until+you+hear+them+speak&type=AllFields&submit=Find,https://books.google.com/books?id=9GmYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+ultimate+quotable+einstein&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX5rm79s3kAhUJvFkKHcPtC6MQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=%22light%20travels%20faster%20than%20sound%22&f=false,https://www.newspapers.com/image/155096521/,https://www.newspapers.com/image/155096489/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/09/06/light-sound/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/09/06/light-sound/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#deaaacbba8b1ac9ebabfb7b2a7bdbfb2b2bbacf0bdb1b3","Did Einstein Say, ‘Certain People Appear Bright Until You Hear Them Speak’?",,,,,

Fact Check:  The internet is replete with quotes attributed to Twain, the author of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” and “Life on the Mississippi.” However, some of these sayings turn out to be apocryphal, as is the case with this quote about literacy. (RELATED: Did Mark Twain Pen This Quote On Kindness?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched a collection of Twain’s written body of work, as well as “The Quotable Mark Twain,” which contains more than 1,800 verified quotes, but found no record of the statement. “There is no evidence the quote originated with Mark Twain,” says Barbara Schmidt, a Twain researcher and writer for the Center for Mark Twain Studies that lists the quote as “unverified” on her website, in an email to the DCNF. The website Quote Investigator traced the earliest strong match of the expression back to a 1914 periodical, though conceptually-related phrases appeared earlier.

Fact Check:  Huxley wrote prolifically during his lifetime, including numerous books, novels, poems and short stories. Some of his best known works, like the books “Brave New World” and “The Doors of Perception,” are widely considered classics.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in this work, or any of his others, could the Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. There is no record of the statement in the archive of his writings housed at the University of California, Los Angeles Library. A search of his collected works, essays, poems and short stories also turned up no matches. The Daily Caller also reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the quote sounded like something Huxley would write. “I doubt that this rather simplistic sentence comes from Aldous Huxley,” said Bernfried Nugel, chairman of the Aldous Huxley Society, in an email to the DCNF. “He wouldn’t have made such a crass distinction between ‘things known’ and ‘things unknown,'” biographer Nicholas Murray told the DCNF via email. “For him they were all part of the same spectrum.”  Huxley’s book “The Doors of Perception,” which details his experience with taking the psychedelic drug mescaline, drew its title from a line written by poet William Blake in his 1790 book “The Marriage of Heaven and Hell,” according to Murray. Both works later provided inspiration to the rock band The Doors in choosing their band name. The website Quote Investigator did find a partial matches for the expression in Blake’s 1790 book, in which he wrote, “If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  However, Quote Investigator believes that the quote may actually be a variation of a statement that The Doors co-founder and keyboardist Ray Manzarek said in a Newsweek profile. “There are things you know about,” Manzarek is quoted as saying in the 1967 interview, “and things you don’t, the known and the unknown, and in between are the doors – that’s us.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It was actually written by Everett Dean Martin in a 1939 academic paper.

The words, however, were Martin’s characterization of Smith’s economic philosophy, not a direct quotation from Smith.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/rick.lowe.90857/posts/10157708355403274,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Adam-Smith,https://www.amazon.com/Inquiry-Nature-Causes-Wealth-Nations/dp/0226763749,https://www.iep.utm.edu/smith/#H3,https://amzn.to/32HdBBd,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/09/03/fact-check-immanuel-kant-science-organized-knowledge-wisdom-life/,https://jamesotteson.com/,https://books.google.com/books?id=K2bPAAAAMAAJ&q=%22As+soon+as+government+management+begins+it+upsets+the+natural+equilibrium+of+industrial+relations,+and+each+interference+only+requires+further+bureaucratic+control+until+the+end+is+the+tyranny+of+the+totalitarian+state%22&dq=%22As+soon+as+government+management+begins+it+upsets+the+natural+equilibrium+of+industrial+relations,+and+each+interference+only+requires+further+bureaucratic+control+until+the+end+is+the+tyranny+of+the+totalitarian+state%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjPkYCni8nkAhWFqp4KHfaiDBkQ6AEwA3oECAQQAg,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/30/equilibrium/#more-6181,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5e2a2c3b28312c1e3a3f3732273d3f32323b2c703d3133",‘Tyranny Of The Totalitarian State’ – Did Adam Smith Say This Quote About Government Regulation?,,,,,

Fact Check  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The “Home Improvement” actor is not the only celebrity whose name has been attached to statements to further a political message on social media. Steve Harvey, host of the”Family Feud” game show, appeared recently in a Facebook post that incorrectly credited him with authoring a pro-Trump statement. (Related: Did Steve Harvey Author This Pro-Trump Statement?) This Facebook post similarly attributes a lengthy anti-Democrat statement containing some factually dubious claims to Allen, seemingly in an attempt to bolster support for Trump’s reelection campaign. “Here are some interesting points to think about prior to 2020, especially to my friends on the fence, like moderate Democrats, Libertarians and Independents and the never Trump Republicans and those thinking of ‘walking away’ from the Democratic party,” the Facebook post credits Allen with saying. Allen has made his conservative-leaning political beliefs publicly known in recent years, yet there is no evidence that Allen ever made this statement. A search of his verified social media accounts returned no results. The Daily Caller didn’t find any credible sources linking the statement to him online either.  “The statement you are referring to was not written by my client,” confirmed Allen’s publicist Marleah Leslie in an email to the Caller.

Fact Check: A lawyer, social activist and politician, Gandhi was a central figure in India’s independence movement from British rule. His teachings and tactics, particularly his use of nonviolent resistance, inspired other social activists, including American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and former South African President Nelson Mandela.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Yet, while Gandhi is highly quotable, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that the quote originated with him. A search of the Gandhi Heritage Portal’s archive, which contains 100 volumes of original documents related to Gandhi, turned up no results. “The quotation is not from Gandhi, but it is an attempt to sort of put Gandhi’s thinking into words,” said Johannes Bakker, a retired University of Guelph professor and editor of “Gandhi and the Gita,” which explores Gandhi’s relationship with the ancient Hindu text, in an email to the DCNF. Nicholas Klein, an American labor union activist, made a similar statement in a 1914 speech, according to Bakker. Indeed, the website Quote Investigator found the earliest “substantive” match in a speech Klein delivered at an Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America conference that year.  “And, my friends, in this story you have a history of this entire movement,” Klein said during the address. “First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you.” President Donald Trump, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders have all shared the falsely attributed quote on social media in recent years.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: Cromwell led the Parliamentary forces against the monarchy in the English Civil War during the 17th century. From 1653 to 1658, he governed the Commonwealth of England, Ireland, and Scotland as the lord protector.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While the British military leader delivered numerous speeches and maintained extensive correspondence during his lifetime, there is no evidence that he authored the saying attributed to him in the Facebook post. The statement does not appear in any of his speeches or letters. Furthermore, the Caller reached out to several experts, none of whom believed the quote to be authentic. “I am confident he did not speak or write those words,” said University of Cambridge history professor John Morrill in an email to the Caller. “The phrase ‘strike while the iron is hot’ is around from no later than the 15th century but as I say I have no sense of him using it.” Indeed, a thematically similar line appears in British author Geoffrey Chaucer‘s 14th century story collection “The Canterbury Tales,” according to the website Quote Investigator. In one of his 24 stories, he included the phrase, “Just so as while that iron is hot men should smite.”  Quote Investigator traced the earliest close match back to a 1782 letter penned by founding father Benjamin Franklin to Welsh preacher and philosopher Richard Price. Franklin wrote, “And we now find that it is not only right to strike while the Iron is hot, but that it is very practicable to heat it by continual Striking.” (RELATED: Did Benjamin Franklin Say This Quote About Avoiding Tyranny?) The saying may have been falsely attributed to Cromwell after British author Charles Caleb Colton made a reference to the British military leader in close proximity to a variation of the quote in 1821, according to Quote Investigator.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/SuccessParadigm/photos/a.955213397828399/2971584196191299/?type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Oliver-Cromwell,https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars,https://amzn.to/2Q0Upgl,https://amzn.to/2LGo8Wb,https://amzn.to/2N8vbdA,https://amzn.to/2PZaNxz,https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/fellows/john-morrill-FBA,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Geoffrey-Chaucer,https://chaucer.fas.harvard.edu/pages/tale-melibee-0,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/05/31/iron-hot/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/05/31/iron-hot/,https://franklinpapers.org/framedVolumes.jsp,http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/People/price.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/18/fact-check-benjamin-franklin-god-given-rights-ignorance-tyranny/,https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Colton,_Charles_Caleb_(DNB00),https://books.google.com/books?id=6AclAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q=%22That%20policy%20that%20can%20strike%20only%20while%20the%20iron%20is%20hot%2C%20will%20be%20overcome%20by%20that%20perseverance%2C%20which%20like%20Cromwell%E2%80%99s%2C%20can%20make%20the%20iron%20hot%20by%20striking.%22&f=false,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/05/31/iron-hot/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#691d1b0c1f061b290d080005100a0805050c1b470a0604","Did Oliver Cromwell Say, ‘Not Only Strike While The Iron Is Hot, But Make It Hot By Striking’?",,,,,

Fact Check: Theodor Seuss Geisel, also known by the pen name Dr. Seuss, is perhaps one of the most well-known authors of children’s books. His witty word play and colorful characters have made many of his works, like “Green Eggs and Ham” and “The Cat in the Hat,” popular among young children.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post in these works, or any of his others. It doesn’t appear in the University of California, San Diego’s collection of Geisel’s editorial cartoons and early advertising artwork either. While there’s no evidence he ever made this statement, Geisel has employed the same literary device in his own writing. For example, in his book “Horton Hatches the Egg,” Geisel wrote, “I meant what I said, and I said what I meant.” The website Quote Investigator traced the earliest partial match back to a 1938 engineering journal, though elements of the quote appeared as early as 1855. In that journal, part of the longer expression attributed to Geisel in the Facebook post appears in quotation marks, indicating the quip might have already been circulating by that time. “Mr. Davies himself admitted that it was highly controversial and open to criticism; but criticism concerned both mind and matter,” reads the passage, according to Quote Investigator. “‘Those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind.'”  Quote Investigator also found several instances in which the statement was employed in anecdotes about seating arrangements during the 1940s, with one crediting American financier and political adviser Bernard Baruch.

To me, old age is always 15 years older than I am.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Bacon ever said or wrote this saying. Fact Check: Bacon, an English philosopher who lived from 1561 to 1626, is widely credited with establishing and popularizing the scientific method. His best known works include the scientific treatise “The New Organon,” the book “The Advancement of Learning,” and the posthumously-published novel “New Atlantis.” He also served as England’s lord chancellor from 1618 to 1621.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While Bacon wrote widely on a variety of subjects, there is no evidence that he authored the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The saying does not appear in any of his written works. (RELATED: Did Da Vinci Say, ‘I Awoke, Only To Find That The Rest Of The World Was Still Asleep?) The Daily Caller also reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the quote originated with Bacon. “I very much doubt this is Bacon,” said Alan Stewart, an English and comparative literature professor at Columbia University, in an email to the Caller. “It doesn’t sound like a man of the seventeenth century at all.” Bernard Baruch, an American financier and political adviser who has also been linked to the quote, employed a variation of it in 1948, according to the website Quote Investigator. However, the saying had already been in circulation for several decades at that point, with Quote Investigator locating the earliest instance of a version of the statement in Walter A. Clark’s 1909 book “A Lost Arcadia: Or, the Story of My Old Community.”  In that book, Clark credited his father with saying, “Old age is always ten years ahead of us.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1936578103135033&set=a.343428672449992&type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Francis-Bacon-Viscount-Saint-Alban,https://lib-dbserver.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/thematic-maps/bacon/bacon.html,https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/bacon1620.pdf,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5500/5500-h/5500-h.htm,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2434/2434-h/2434-h.htm,https://books.google.com/books?id=IFwXAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=complete+works+francis+bacon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX-K3xiMTkAhUxJzQIHe9JBVkQ6AEwBXoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=%22old%20age%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=Guc0DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=complete+works+francis+bacon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX-K3xiMTkAhUxJzQIHe9JBVkQ6AEwBnoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=%22old%20age%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=QJ6vZ6CSXvUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=complete+works+francis+bacon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX-K3xiMTkAhUxJzQIHe9JBVkQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=%22old%20age%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=68ALAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=complete+works+francis+bacon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiX-K3xiMTkAhUxJzQIHe9JBVkQ6AEwAXoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=%22old%20age%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=2q5JAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Works+of+Lord+Bacon:+With+an+Introductory+Essay,+and+a+Portrait,+Volume+2&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwioyvrN5LzkAhWSIzQIHTd_DtAQ6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=%22I%20will%20never%20be%20an%20old%20man.%20To%20me%2C%20old%20age%20is%20always%20fifteen%20years%20older%20than%20I%20am.%22&f=false,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/07/18/fact-check-da-vinci-i-awoke-world-still-asleep/,https://english.columbia.edu/people/profile/410,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bernard-Baruch,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/02/05/old/#more-21614,https://archive.org/details/lostarcadiaorsto00clar/page/n327,https://books.google.com/books?id=xPMxAQAAMAAJ&q=+%22years+ahead%22#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#40343225362f32002421292c3923212c2c25326e232f2d","Did Francis Bacon Say, ‘Old Age Is Always 15 Years Older Than I Am’?",,,,,

Fact Check: Plato and other ancient Greek philosophers are popular targets of apocryphal quotations. This statement, while often attributed to Plato, seems to fall into that category. (RELATED: Did Plato Say, ‘Be Kind, Everyone You Meet Is Fighting A Hard Battle’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    An internet search reveals a number of blogs debating the origin of the quote, though none credibly link it to the ancient Greek philosopher. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of the expression in Plato’s complete works. “It just doesn’t sound to me like Plato,” says University of Chicago professor and Plato expert Nathan Tarcov in an email to the DCNF. “I can’t think of a dialogue where it would fit.” The quote has also been ascribed to Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana, though it’s unclear if he coined the expression. It appears in his 1922 book “Soliloquies in England and Later Soliloquies,” where he writes without attributing it to another source, “Only the dead are safe; only the dead have seen the end of war.” The attribution to Plato gained popularity in the 1960s after General Douglas MacArthur credited the ancient Greek philosopher with coining it in a 1962 address to West Point cadets.

Fact Check: Widely regarded as an important sports figure of the 20th century, Ali was a three-time world heavyweight boxing champion, with 56 wins over the course of his career. (RELATED: Did Yogi Berra Say, ‘In Theory There Is No Difference Between Practice And Theory. In Practice, There Is’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though he made numerous quotable comments during his lifetime, the Daily Caller found no record of Ali ever making the statement. An internet search turned up no instances of him saying the expression in interviews. It doesn’t appear on his verified Twitter account or in his autobiographies either. “The Muhammad Ali misattribution occurred because he was featured prominently in an Adidas ad blitz, and sometimes the words were printed on his picture,” writes the website Quote Investigator. Indeed, sportswear company Adidas employed a longer version of the statement in its 2004 “Impossible is Nothing” brand advertising campaign. The entire “manifesto,” which was superimposed onto or adjacent to images of well-known athletes, reads: “Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they’re given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It’s an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It’s a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary.” “The true creators were ad copy professionals,” Quote Investigator further explains.  Aimee Lehto Schewe, a copywriter who worked on the campaign, coined the specific statement attributed to Ali in this Facebook post as part of the campaign’s longer “manifesto,” according to her website. “It continues to resonate and get passed around on the internet, quoted by celebrities, and misattributed to Muhammad Ali,” writes Lehto Schewe. “Which is super flattering! But also a little frustrating. But mostly great!”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Ali’s daughter Laila, also a world champion boxer, appeared in the ad campaign too.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218251036361611&set=a.2226254330148&type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammad-Ali-boxer,https://www.google.com/search?q=muhammad+ali+biography&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS850US850&oq=muhammad+ali+biography&aqs=chrome..69i57.4247j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammad-Ali-boxer,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/28/yogi-berra-theory-difference-practice/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%22big%20word%20thrown%20around%22%22%20(from%3AMuhammadAli)&src=typed_query,https://books.google.com/books?id=tSGpCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=muhammad+ali+the+greatest&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjq04rjuLrkAhWpslkKHamtDWcQ6AEwAnoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22big%20word%20thrown%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=h6G-Cy5c0GgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=muhammad+ali+the+soul+of+a+butterfly&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwia8LaUubrkAhXOo1kKHQ2pDAUQ6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22big%20word%20thrown%22&f=false,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/28/impossible-is/,https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/180-tbwa-put-olympic-spin-adidas-impossible-nothing-73783/,https://www.adidas-group.com/en/media/news-archive/press-releases/2004/impossible-nothing-adidas-launches-new-global-brand-advertising-/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/28/impossible-is/,http://www.withtwoees.com/about,https://adage.com/article/broadcast/q-a-lee-clow-chuck-mcbride-reflect-adidas-coming-age/103561,http://www.withtwoees.com/work#/impossibleisnothing/,http://www.withtwoees.com/work#/impossibleisnothing/,https://lailaali.com/about/bio/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#30444255465f42705451595c4953515c5c55421e535f5d",Did Muhammad Ali Say This Quote About The ‘Impossible’?,,,,,

Ocasio-Cortez also confirmed on Twitter that she did not, in fact, make this statement. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Since her election to the House of Representatives in 2018, Ocasio-Cortez has become a popular target for fake quotes. (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Say, ‘Under Capitalism, Man Oppresses Man. Under Socialism, It’s The Other Way Around’?) This Facebook post, which appears to be a screen grab of a tweet about people fueling cars in preparation for Hurricane Dorian, attempts to paint the freshman congresswoman in an unintelligent light. “This wouldn’t be an issue if they had electric cars,” she allegedly tweeted. “If power is out for a week how are they going to get gas?” There is, however, no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez tweeted this. A search of her Twitter accounts — @AOC and @RepAOC — turned up no results. ProPublica’s archive of Ocasio-Cortez’s deleted tweets had no record of her tweeting and then deleting it either. When asked on Twitter by former White House aide Sebastian Gorka if the tweet was real, Ocasio-Cortez responded, “Nope.”   Nope. — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 31, 2019  Although the congresswoman didn’t tweet this statement, she did take to Twitter to comment on Hurricane Dorian, writing, “This is what climate change looks like: it hits vulnerable communities first.” (RELATED: Does This Image Show A Bahamian Town Destroyed By Hurricane Dorian?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Dorian made landfall in the North Carolina Outer Banks Friday morning as a Category 1 hurricane, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Fact Check:  Chuck Palahniuk, a best-selling author, published the “Fight Club” novel in 1996. The book — which tells the story of a listless, unnamed office worker who helps start an underground fight club — was adapted for film a few years later, starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the expression attributed to “Fight Club” in the Facebook post doesn’t appear in the book nor the movie. Searching the novel and screenplay for the quote returned no matches. The website Quote Investigator traced the earliest strong match for the statement back to a 1928 newspaper column by American humorist and journalist Robert Quillen, though elements of the quote appeared earlier. In that column, he defined “Americanism” as “using money you haven’t earned to buy things you don’t need to impress people you don’t like.” A year later, one Edgar Allan Moss published a variation of the expression under the pseudonym Junius, according to etymologist Barry Popik. Others also employed the statement after it was already in circulation. The quote was likely attributed to “Fight Club” because it sounded like something that might have been said in the book or movie, according to Quote Investigator. At one point in the book, a character says, “Advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they don’t need. Generations have been working in jobs they hate, just so they can buy what they don’t really need.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

His wife Eniko Parrish has said that Hart is “going to be just fine.” Fact Check: A stand-up comedian and actor, Hart has starred in numerous films over the years, including “Ride Along” in 2014 and “Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle” in 2017. He also has numerous stand-up routines on Netflix, including his comedy special “Irresponsible.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Hart and two other people were involved in a car accident early Sunday morning, according to CBS News. A man identified as Jared Black lost control while driving Hart’s 1970 Plymouth Barracuda in Calabasas, California, causing the vehicle to go off the road and roll down an embankment. “According to medical sources at UCLA Medical center, the comedian suffered trauma to the nerves in his spine and throat which have left him paralyzed from the neck down,” reads the Facebook post. “In addition to being diagnosed with quadriplegia, he also suffered trauma in his neck, causing irreversible damage to his larynx, leaving both vocal cords paralyzed.” However, there’s no evidence that Hart has become paralyzed as a result of the accident. An internet search turned up no credible sources reporting that he sustained the injuries described in the Facebook post. A California Highway Patrol (CHP) incident report obtained by CNN reveals that Hart and the driver did suffer “major back injuries” from the accident, though the comedian was able to leave the scene to get medical attention at his nearby home before being transported to the hospital. He later underwent back surgery, according to Yahoo News.  Hart’s wife told TMZ in a video interview on Monday that the “Ride Along” actor was “going to be just fine.” Black, who CHP told E! News was not under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident, also got transported to the hospital. The third female occupant suffered only minor injuries.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The claim that Hart was paralyzed in the car crash actually comes from an article published on the parody news website LFR Solutions, which disclaims at the bottom of the article, “The stories may mimic articles found in the headlines, but rest assured that they are purely satirical.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1651743654958040&set=a.174088419390245&type=3&theater,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1408253/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_36,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2283362/?ref_=nv_sr_2?ref_=nv_sr_2,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/irresponsible-reviewed-kevin-harts-family-values,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-hart-car-accident-hospitalized-major-back-injuries-california-car-crash-plymouth-barracuda-jared-black/,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/01/entertainment/kevin-hart-car-crash/index.html,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/kevin-hart-bought-something-blue-for-his-birthday-a-custom-1970-plymouth-cuda,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1651743654958040&set=a.174088419390245&type=3&theater,https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/01/entertainment/kevin-hart-car-crash/index.html,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kevin-hart-car-crash-malibu-hills-back-injuries-report,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/kevin-hart-undergoes-back-surgery-after-car-crash-expected-to-fully-recover-001619851.html,https://www.tmz.com/2019/09/02/kevin-hart-back-surgery-car-accident/,https://dailycaller.com/2019/09/03/kevin-hart-eniko-parrish-car-accident-injuries/,https://www.eonline.com/news/1069671/kevin-hart-may-need-back-surgery-after-suffering-from-car-crash-injuries-report,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-hart-car-accident-hospitalized-major-back-injuries-california-car-crash-plymouth-barracuda-jared-black/,https://lfrsolutions.com/boosie/1543/,http://lfrsolutions.com/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9de9eff8ebf2efddf9fcf4f1e4fefcf1f1f8efb3fef2f0","No, Kevin Hart Was Not Paralyzed ‘From The Neck Down’ In A Car Accident",,,,,

Literally, everything!” Verdict: False The photo does show a coastal town devastated by a hurricane, but it is actually Mexico Beach, Florida, in the wake of Hurricane Michael in 2018. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Hurricane Dorian has been moving northward toward the U.S. after stalling over the Bahamas, reported The New York Times. The slow-moving storm battered the Bahamas with high winds and floodwaters for more than a day, killing at least seven people, according to CNN. It was a Category 5 hurricane over the weekend, but has since been downgraded to Category 2 (at the time of publication). Some conveyed their sympathies regarding the situation, with numerous people sharing the alleged picture on Facebook. “Prayers … Abaco Island, Bahamas,” reads one such Facebook post.  The image does not, however, depict the Abaco Islands town of Marsh Harbour in the Bahamas. Taken by Getty photographer Joe Raedle, it shows the damage caused by Hurricane Michael in Mexico Beach, Florida, in 2018, according to the caption. “The aftermath of hurricane Michael is seen on October 17, 2018 in Mexico Beach, Florida,” reads the Getty Images caption. “The hurricane hit on October 10th along the Florida Panhandle as a category 4 storm causing massive damage and claimed the lives of more then [sic] a dozen people.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Hurricane Michael was the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous United States since 1992 and the strongest on record to ever hit the Florida Panhandle, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Fact Check:  Shakespeare, sometimes referred to as the Bard of Avon, is an influential English playwright, poet and actor, active during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Many of his works, such as “Macbeth” and “Romeo and Juliet,” are widely considered classics. (RELATED: Did Shakespeare Say A Quote About A ‘Battle Of Wits’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that this saying originated with Shakespeare. It doesn’t appear in those plays, or any of his others. Searching his collected poems also turned up no results. Two experts — “Shakespeare Early and Late: A Textbook” author Paul Budra and Oxford University professor Emma Smith – confirmed in emails to the DCNF that Shakespeare did not author the statement. The origin of the quote is not definitively known, though it is popularly attributed to Shakespeare and Spanish-American philosopher George Santayana, who is often cited without providing a specific source. A variation of the expression also appears in amateur poet Reginald Vincent Holmes’ 1955 poem “The Magic of Sound.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Wisdom is organized life.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  This saying does not appear in any of Kant’s writing. Fact Check:  A German philosopher active during the 18th century Enlightenment movement, Kant made contributions to the fields of epistemology, metaphysics, ethics and aesthetics. His work “Critique of Pure Reason,” along with his other writings, helped establish him as an important figure in modern Western philosophy.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no record of the saying in Kant’s writings. A search of several collections of his works turned up no matching or similar expressions. “Kant said a lot of interesting things but he did not say this,” McMaster University professor and Kant scholar David Clark said in an email to the DCNF. “It sounds like the sort of thing a British philosopher might attribute to the Prussian master in order to give his or her work a certain credibility and gravitas.” The statement attributed to Kant in the Facebook post may actually be a combination of two quotes, one from sociologist Herbert Spencer and another from historian Will Durant, according to the website Quote Investigator. “Science is organized knowledge; and before knowledge can be organized, some of it must first be possessed,” Spencer wrote in an 1854 essay titled “The Art of Education.”  Durant appears to have combined Spencer’s quote with one of his own in his 1926 book “The Story of Philosophy,” in which Durant chronicles the work of history’s greatest philosophers, including Kant. The expression is the author’s attempt at capturing, in his own words, the views of Kant, but is not a direct quotation from the German philosopher.

Chances are you’ll end up working for one.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Despite being widely attributed to Gates, the expression actually originated with political commentator Charles J. Sykes. Fact Check:  Gates, a billionaire with an estimated $96.5 billion net worth in 2019, cofounded software firm Microsoft in 1975. He and his wife Melinda chair the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world’s largest private charitable organization, according to Forbes.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Although the quote attributed to Gates in the Facebook post has been linked to him since at least 2010, there is no evidence that it originated with Gates. An internet search reveals no credible sources ascribing it to him. The Daily Caller News Foundation search his books – “The Road Ahead” and “Bussiness @ the Speed of Thought” – but found no record of the expression in either. The statement, which often appears in a list called “Rules Kids Won’t Learn In School” that also gets attributed to Gates online, actually comes from Sykes, a political commentator. In his book “50 Rules Kids Won’t Learn in School,” Sykes writes, “Be nice to nerds. You may end up working for them. We all could.” Sykes confirmed in a Twitter direct message to the DCNF that the quote originated with him, not Gates.

Onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Twain ever saying or writing this quote. It may be a variation of an expression quoted in an 1878 New York newspaper. Fact Check: Samuel Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain, wrote several novels that are widely considered classics, including “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” and “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, The Daily Caller found no evidence that Twain ever wrote the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The saying does not appear in those books, or any of his other works. “That is yet another good one he did not say,” Winthrop University english professor John Bird told The Caller via email. “The core idea of the quotation under examination appeared as a biblical proverb,” writes the website Quote Investigator. “The popular saying that has been incorrectly attributed to Mark Twain is part of a large diverse family of statements that began to appear by 1878.” Indeed, a variation of the quote can be traced back to a 1878 edition of The Rochester Evening Express, where it appeared attributed to another periodical: “Don’t argue with a fool, or the listener will say there is a pair of you. — Cincinnati Breakfast Table.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/donna.myers.9066/posts/2770899266255613,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Twain,https://amzn.to/2Llqx8A,https://amzn.to/34bM64b,https://books.google.com/books?id=SiFa-XvuQmAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=adventures+of+huckleberry+finn&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj33smW8KrkAhXis1kKHeqYDJsQ6AEwAHoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22Never%20argue%20with%20a%20fool%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=rpC-JauA-xwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+adventures+of+tom+sawyer&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjT2LGu8KrkAhWMzlkKHSRSDJsQ6AEwAXoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22never%20argue%20with%20a%20fool%22&f=false,http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/about/srchmtf.html,http://faculty.winthrop.edu/birdj/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/02/19/fool/,https://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2024/Rochester%20NY%20Evening%20Express/Rochester%20NY%20Evening%20Express%201878%20Apr-Nov%201878/Rochester%20NY%20Evening%20Express%201878%20Apr-Nov%201878%20-%200133.pdf,https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85054400/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#61151304170e13210500080d1802000d0d04134f020e0c","Did Mark Twain Say, ‘Never Argue With A Fool’?",,,,,

It may have evolved from the writing of ancient Confucian philosopher Xunzi. Fact Check: The internet is replete with quotes attributed to the founding fathers, Franklin in particular. However, there is no evidence that this particular saying originated with Franklin, a signee of the Declaration of Independence and highly influential inventor. (RELATED: Did Benjamin Franklin Say, ‘Any Fool Can Criticize, Condemn And Complain’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched the collected writings of Franklin but found no record of it or any variations. “I’ve never encountered it. And ‘involve me’ sounds very un-Franklin,” says H.W. Brands, author of “The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin,” in an email to the DCNF. Thomas Kidd, author of “Benjamin Franklin: The Religious Life of a Founding Father,” also told the DCNF in an email that he had never encountered the quote. The statement may actually have evolved from the writing of ancient Confucian philosopher Xun Kuang, better known as Xunzi, according to the website Quote Investigator. Xunzi wrote a thematically similar statement in one of his works, which was translated into English and published in “Xunzi: The Complete Text.”  “Not having heard of it is not as good as having heard of it. Having heard of it is not as good as having seen it,” reads the saying from Xunzi. “Having seen it is not as good as knowing it. Knowing it is not as good as putting it into practice.” Though Franklin did not coin the expression attributed to him in the Facebook post, he was an advocate for education. In his 1749 publication “Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania,” Franklin wrote, “The good education of youth has been esteemed by wise men in all ages, as the surest foundation of the happiness of both private families and of commonwealths.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Rowling is the first person to fall off Forbes magazine’s billionaires list due to charitable giving.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Rowling’s departure from the Forbes World Billionaires list was precipitated by her charitable giving and Britain’s high tax rates. Forbes confirmed that Rowling is not the first billionaire to get bumped off the list for charitable giving. Fact Check: Forbes magazine publishes an annual ranking of the world’s wealthiest people, all of whom have a documented net worth of at least $1 billion U.S. dollars. The Forbes World’s Billionaires list, which ranks its members from most wealthy to least, was topped in 2018 by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos with an estimated $112 billion.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Rowling, author of the popular “Harry Potter” fantasy novels, debuted on the 2004 Billionaires list as the first billionaire author at $1 billion. In 2012, she fell off the list due to a combination of charitable giving and high tax rates. “New information about Rowlings’ estimated $160 million in charitable giving combined with Britain’s high tax rates bumped the Harry Potter scribe from our list this year,” wrote Forbes. Rowling founded the Children’s High Level Group, now called Lumos, in 2005 to help “disadvantaged” children in orphanages around the world. Through her charitable trust, Volant, she has also donated to organizations that support women, children, and the alleviation of poverty. “You have a moral responsibility when you’ve been given far more than you need, to do wise things with it and give intelligently,” the Telegraph quoted Rowling as saying about charitable giving in 2011.  However, Forbes confirmed in an email to the Daily Caller that Rowling is not the first billionaire to fall off the list due, in part, to charitable donations. Luisa Kroll, an assistant managing editor at Forbes, pointed to several individuals whose philanthropy cost them their spots on the list prior to Rowling, including American Century Investments founder James Stowers in 2001 and Golden West Financial Corporation founder Herb Sandler in 2006. Chuck Feeney, the Duty Free Shoppers co-founder who was worth $1.9 billion in 1991, is another example. His Atlantic Philanthropies has distributed $8 billion in grants from 1981 to 2016.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “He’s the person we site [sic] as truly trying to give it all away,” Kroll told the Caller in an email. Though Rowling is no longer included on the Forbes World Billionaires list, the “Harry Potter” author still has a substantial fortune. As of July 9, Forbes estimates that Rowling had already earned $92 million in 2019.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10220236251765602&set=a.2210315586536&type=3&theater,https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/list/;,https://www.forbes.com/profile/jeff-bezos/#43c562e91b23,https://kids.scholastic.com/kids/books/harry-potter/,https://www.forbes.com/pictures/emjd45jd/j-k-rowling/#2c03940b6825,https://www.jkrowling.com/charity/we-are-lumos/,https://www.volanttrust.org/about-us/#other-funding,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8557246/Duchess-of-Cornwall-asks-J-K-Rowling-for-Harry-Potter-magic.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/#6520bfa3397d,https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mfg45gjkk/james-stowers-u-s/#e3527ec65cb7,https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-herbert-sandler-dies-20190606-story.html,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2012/09/18/chuck-feeney-the-billionaire-who-is-trying-to-go-broke/#796037f3291c,https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/our-story,https://www.forbes.com/profile/jk-rowling/#3fad94173aeb,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#add9dfc8dbc2dfedc9ccc4c1d4ceccc1c1c8df83cec2c0",Is J.K.

It was said, however, by the fictional Thoreau in the play “The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail.” Fact Check: An essayist and poet, Thoreau was a prominent member of the transcendentalist movement that emphasized intuitive, spiritual thinking over scientific, empirical thinking. He is perhaps best known for his 1854 book “Walden,” which is widely considered a literary classic.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Although Thoreau discussed authentic self-expression in some of his works, he did not write the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Walden Woods Project, a Massachusetts non-profit dedicated to preserving Thoreau’s legacy and the Walden Woods, includes the saying on its “Mis-Quotations” list. Furthermore, the Daily Caller found no record of the quote in any collections of his books, essays, poems or letters. “That’s a very common misattribution,” confirmed Thoreau Institute Library Curator Jeffrey Cramer in an email to the Caller. (RELATED: Did Oscar Wilde Say, ‘Be Yourself; Everyone Else Is Already Taken’?) “This quote isn’t by Thoreau himself,” said University of Notre Dame professor Laura Dassow Walls in an email to the Caller, “but is spoken [by] the character of Thoreau in the 1970 play, ‘The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,’ by Robert Edwin Lee and Jerome Lawrence.”  Indeed, the quote comes from Lee and Lawrence’s play “The Night Thoreau Spent in Jail,” uttered by the Thoreau character. However, the lines were imagined by the play’s writers, not the historical figure of Thoreau that this character is based on.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/FusePhase/photos/a.127666804070184/1003011489869040/?type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-David-Thoreau,https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/transcendentalism/,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/205/205-h/205-h.htm,https://www.walden.org,https://www.walden.org/thoreau/mis-quotations/,https://archives.yale.edu/repositories/11/resources/1454,https://www.amazon.com/Henry-David-Thoreau-Collection/dp/1500345016,https://books.google.com/books?id=b21bAAAAMAAJ&dq=henry+david+thoreau+collection&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22what+you+think+somebody+else%27%22,https://books.google.com/books?id=In9bAAAAMAAJ&dq=henry+david+thoreau+collection&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22what+you+think+somebody+else%27%22,https://books.google.com/books?id=f_gRAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=henry+david+thoreau+letters&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-3raZsKbkAhWo1FkKHanZB7QQ6AEwAnoECAMQAg#v=onepage&q=%22what%20you%20think%20somebody%20else's%22&f=false,https://www.walden.org/property/the-thoreau-institute/,http://www.jeffreyscramer.com/about.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/27/fact-check-oscar-wilde-be-yourself-everyone-already-taken/,https://english.nd.edu/people/faculty/walls/,https://books.google.com/books?id=y7O2Mpt6zNsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+night+thoreau+spent+in+jail&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjenPvPuKbkAhWOtlkKHW3eBl0Q6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=%22be%20yourself%22&f=false,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#53272136253c211337323a3f2a30323f3f36217d303c3e","Did Henry David Thoreau Say, ‘Be Yourself — Not Your Idea Of What You Think Somebody Else’s Idea Of Yourself Should Be’?",,,,,

Eliot Say This Quote About The Importance Of Libraries?,2019-08-29,checkyourfact,,"FACT CHECK: Did T.S. Eliot Say This Quote About The Importance Of Libraries?10:07 AM 08/29/2019Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsA post shared on Facebook claims poet T.S. Eliot once said, “The very existence of libraries affords the best evidence that we may yet have hope for the future of man.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The saying does not appear in any of Eliot’s writings. Fact Check: Thomas Stearns Eliot, better known as T.S. Eliot, was an American poet who won the Nobel Prize in 1948. His poems, including “The Waste Land” and “Four Quartets,” helped establish him as an important figure in the 20th century modernist movement.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in these poems, or any of his others, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find the statement. It doesn’t appear in his plays or correspondence either. On the T.S. Eliot Society’s list of popular quotes, the quote attributed to Eliot in the Facebook post is categorized as “source unknown.” “We have been asked about this quote before, and we put out a call to our members here in the U.K. — but no-one could provide a source for it!” Paul Keers, chair of the T.S. Eliot Society, told the DCNF in an email. Another expert, John Carroll University associate english professor Jayme Stayer, noted that the quote sounded like something Eliot would have said.  The earliest known variation of the expression dates back to 1992, where it appears in author and former librarian Jayne Ann Krentz’s novel “Perfect Partners,” according to the website Quote Investigator. It has been attributed to Eliot since at least 1999, though it’s unclear how the quote became linked to him.

In practice, there is.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence that this saying originated with Berra. Fact Check: The only player in Major League Baseball history to win 10 World Series titles, Berra played catcher for the New York Yankees for 18 seasons.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Aside from his ball-playing skills, Berra is perhaps best known for his humorous non sequiturs called “Yogi-isms,” which were eventually compiled into the 1998 book “The Yogi Book: I Really Didn’t Say Everything I Said!” (RELATED: Did Albert Einstein Say, ‘Two Things Inspire Me To Awe – The Starry Heavens Above And The Moral Universe Within’?) However, the quote appears nowhere in that book, or any of his others. “As to our knowledge, that quote is not in fact genuine,” confirmed Nikki Morton of the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center in an email to the Daily Caller News Foundation. The website Quote Investigator traced the earliest instance of the saying back to 1882, where it appeared in the Yale Literary Magazine. Benjamin Brewster, a student at Yale University, recounted a philosophical argument he had with a friend, writing, “What does his lucid explanation amount to but this, that in theory there is no difference between theory and practice, while in practice there is?”  In the 1980s, Walter Savitch included the quote — cited only as a “remark overheard at a computer science conference” — in his computer programming textbook, according to etymologist Barry Popik. A variation of this expression has also been attributed to theoretical physicist Albert Einstein.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: As the 16th president, Lincoln wrote and delivered numerous statements that are frequently quoted on the internet. However, the Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Lincoln ever said this expression, which has been attributed to him since at least 2003. (RELATED: Did Abraham Lincoln Say, ‘It’s Not The Years In Your Life That Count. It’s The Life In Your Years’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “I could find no evidence of Lincoln having made this comment in our database,” said Daniel Worthington, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln, in an email to the DCNF. “Probably mis-attributed to him.” Indeed, the DCNF searched the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library’s digital archive for the words “thorn bushes” but turned up no results. The saying does not appear in Lincoln’s collected works at the University of Michigan either. Abraham Lincoln Association Editor and Secretary James Cornelius also told the DCNF via email that he did not recognize the expression, saying, “I have never heard of it in doing Lincoln research/cataloguing since 1997.” The quote may actually have originated with French journalist and author Alphonse Karr, according to the website Quote Investigator. A variation of the saying appears in his 1853 book “Lettres Écrites De Mon Jardin,” where he writes, “You complain about seeing thorny rose bushes; me, I rejoice and give thanks to the gods that thorns have roses.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

A search of the George Eliot Archive’s collection of her novels, essays, poems and translations turned up no record of the quote. It doesn’t appear in her collected letters either. (RELATED: Did Oscar Wilde Say, ‘Be Yourself; Everyone Else Is Already Taken’?) The Caller also reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the quote was authentic. “George Eliot did not make that statement,” said retired Boston College professor Rosemarie Bodenheimer in an email to the Caller. “Nor did she believe what it says.” The quote may actually have evolved from a line in Adelaide Anne Procter’s 1859 poem “A Legend of Provenance,” according to the website Quote Investigator. In that poem, Procter writes, “No star is ever lost we once have seen, we always may be what we might have been.”  Two decades later, in 1881, the alleged quote appeared in the monthly journal “Literary News,” after the editors asked the readers to submit their favorite Eliot quotes for a contest. It was included in the unvetted list of submissions without citing a source, according to Quote Investigator. “Procter’s statement would have been rephrased and then reassigned to Eliot,” writes Quote Investigator. “This process may have occurred in the mind of the individual who sent the quote to ‘Literary News.'”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/310736772846582/photos/a.310799302840329/424527661467492/?type=3&theater,https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/eliot_george.shtml,https://books.google.com/books?id=iPLjUhiXAhYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=middlemarch&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjKitzr9_DjAhVtmeAKHTSQA6EQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=%22It's%20never%20too%20late%20to%20be%20what%20you%20might%20have%20been%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=zUdrBsuRurkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=daniel+deronda&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO9JOA-PDjAhVnh-AKHYwZDo8Q6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&q=%22It's%20never%20too%20late%20to%20be%20what%20you%20might%20have%20been%22&f=false,https://georgeeliotarchive.org/search?query=%22It%27s+never+too+late+to+be+what+you+might+have+been%22&query_type=keyword&record_types%5B%5D=Item&record_types%5B%5D=File&record_types%5B%5D=Collection&record_types%5B%5D=SimplePagesPage&submit_search=Search,https://books.google.com/books?id=MAC7AAAAIAAJ&dq=the+george+eliot+letters&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22It%27s+never+too+late+to+be+what+you+might+have+been%22,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/27/fact-check-oscar-wilde-be-yourself-everyone-already-taken/,https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/english/people/retired-faculty/bodenheimer--rosemarie.html,https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/legend-provence,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/11/24/never-too-late/,https://books.google.com/books?id=nbAKAAAAYAAJ&q=%22never+too%22#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/11/24/never-too-late/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/11/24/never-too-late/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#15616770637a675571747c796c7674797970673b767a78","Did George Eliot Say, ‘It’s Never Too Late To Be What You Might Have Been’?",,,,,

True power is restraint,” the alleged quote continues. “If words control you that means everyone else controls you. Breath, and allow things to pass.” Verdict: False The Daily Caller found no evidence that Buffett said this quote, though it has been linked to him since a parody account tweeted it in 2018. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Buffett, a successful investor known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” is the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. The multinational holding company owns more than 60 subsidiaries, including auto insurer GEICO and food manufacturer Kraft Heinz. According to Forbes, Buffett has an estimated net worth of $82.5 billion. The alleged quote was first linked to Buffet in 2018, after a Twitter account (which has since been suspended) masquerading as the billionaire investor tweeted it out, along with other pieces of life advice. After the tweet went viral, a spokesperson for Buffett confirmed to ABC News that the account was fake. Contributing even more to its dubiousness, the statement cannot be found anywhere in in his book “The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America.” Elements of the statement have appeared on social media since at least 2009, according to the website Quote Investigator. The closest match for the quote attributed to Buffett in the Facebook post comes from a 2016 Twitter thread.  Martial artist Bruce Lee has also been credited with coining the words, though there is no evidence he said them either. No credible sources link the quote to him, and the authors of two Lee biographies – Matthew Polly and Bruce Thomas – said that they did not recognize it in emails to the Daily Caller.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  Wilde was an Irish poet, playwright and author who was deeply involved in the aesthetic movement of the late 19th century. Many of his works, such as “The Importance of Being Earnest” and “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” are still highly regarded in literary circles.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The alleged quote featured in the Facebook post has been widely attributed to Wilde online, yet there is no credible source linking it to him. The DCNF searched a collection of his complete works but found nothing matching the statement. (RELATED: Did Oscar Wilde Coin This Saying About Happiness?) The Oscar Wilde Society Chairman Donald Mead confirmed to the DCNF in an email that the quote is not genuine, writing, “This is definitely not Oscar. It is all over the internet with no source.” “Definitely not Wilde!” concurred Sos Eltis, author of “Revising Wilde: Society and Subversion in the Plays of Oscar Wilde,” in an email to the DCNF. “Hilarious that anyone claims it is.” While there is no evidence Wilde ever coined the saying, it is thematically similar to several statements about identity found in his writings. In a 1987 letter to his friend and lover Lord Alfred Douglas, Wilde wrote, “It is tragic how few people ever ‘possess their souls’ before they die.”  The website Quote Investigator traced the earliest instance of the quote back to a 1999 post on Usenet, an early computer network of discussion threads, though a thematically-related statement by theologian Thomas Merton was published in The Hudson Review several decades earlier.

Fact Check:  The internet is replete with both genuine and spurious quotes from the British philosopher and mathematician. The quote attributed to Russell in the Facebook post appears to fall into the latter group. (RELATED: Did Bertrand Russell Say, ‘The Time You Enjoy Wasting Is Not Wasted Time’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched the roughly 130,000 records in the Bertrand Russell Archives at McMaster University, but found no matching phrases in his manuscripts, letters or notes. Beverly Bayzat, a library assistant at the Bertrand Russell Archives, confirmed in an email to the DCNF that the library had no records of the saying. “I’d have to say this is not a Russell quote,” said Andrew Irvine, a Russell scholar at the University of British Columbia, in an email to the DCNF. “Both I and a colleague have looked up this quote in the past and we’ve never been able to find a source.” The website Quote Investigator traced a variation of the quote back to a 1931 article in The Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, where it appeared without attribution. This article is the earliest known instance of the quote, though elements of it appeared earlier, according to etymologist Barry Popik. While there is no evidence that Russell wrote this quote about war, he may well have agreed with the sentiment. A lifelong peace activist and proponent of nuclear disarmament, Russell often wrote about the subject of war. In his book “Fact and Fiction,” he wrote, “Either Man will abolish war, or war will abolish Man.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It may actually come from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Fact Check: A diplomat and writer active during the Italian Renaissance, Machiavelli is widely considered the “father of modern political theory.” He is perhaps best known for his political treatise “The Prince,” in which he expounded his political philosophy.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though Machiavelli discussed a variety of political subjects in his writings, there is no evidence that he authored the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Caller found no record of the statement in “The Prince,” or in any collections of his other works. “I can confirm that Machiavelli never wrote anything remotely along these lines,” Ross King, author of “Machiavelli: Philosopher of Power,” told the Caller in an email. “It’s directly contrary to his political philosophy, which is concerned with preserving the ‘status quo’ (an expression he never would have used — which makes the quote even more untenable).” The expression may actually have originated with Gingrich, according to “Machiavelli for Mayors” author Ian Chadwick. Gingrich is quoted by The Los Angeles Times in 1991 as making this statement in response to criticism from other members of Congress.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/fmwilkerson/posts/10219255608249043,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Niccolo-Machiavelli,https://www.biography.com/scholar/niccolo-machiavelli,https://jmp.princeton.edu/events/interpreting-prince-debate-commemorating-500th-anniversary-machiavellis-classic-text,https://books.google.com/books?id=Qc3ODgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+prince+machiavelli&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-lq6O5aDkAhXnwVkKHVXsB-wQ6AEwAXoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=%22preserve%20the%20status%20quo%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=IGL1DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=complete+works+of+machiavelli&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG_vvA5aDkAhWSrVkKHcsqCAEQ6AEwBnoECAkQAg#v=onepage&q=%22preserve%20the%20status%20quo%22&f=false,https://archive.org/details/worksnicholasma00prusgoog/page/n6,http://rosskingbooks.com/,http://rosskingbooks.com/books.html,http://ianchadwick.com/blog/more-machiavellian-misquotes/,https://history.house.gov/People/Detail/13850,http://ianchadwick.com/blog/the-municipal-machiavelli/,https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-08-25-tm-2004-story.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3d494f584b524f7d595c5451445e5c5151584f135e5250",‘I Want To Overthrow It’ — Did Machiavelli Say This Quote About The Status Quo?,,,,,

The saying dates back to at least the 1970s. Fact Check: Churchill served as prime minister of the U.K. from 1940 to 1945 and from 1951 to 1955. He is widely recognized for his role in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Despite his prolific record as a speaker and writer, Churchill did not make the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The Daily Caller found no record of the saying in the Churchill Archive, which houses around 800,000 original documents related to the statesman, or in the Churchill Papers, another collection of his works. Furthermore, the International Churchill Society has identified the quote as falsely attributed to Churchill. The statement was also included by Hillsdale College historian and Churchill expert Richard Langworth in a 2018 list entitled “All The ‘Quotes’ Winston Churchill Never Said.” The source of the aphorism is unknown, but it has been in use since at least 1970s. In 1976, New Jersey General Assembly Speaker Joseph LeFante used the expression during a General Assembly meeting, without attributing it to a specific source.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157496616974299&set=a.45057119298&type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Winston-Churchill,https://www.nationalchurchillmuseum.org/world-war-ii-churchills-finest-hour.html,https://www.nationalchurchillmuseum.org/winston-churchills-speeches.html,http://www.churchillarchive.com/search?searchString=%22courage+is+also+what+it+takes+to+sit+down+and+listen%22&exportFormat=endNote&searchFormSubmit=true,http://www-archives.chu.cam.ac.uk/perl/search?text=%22courage+is+also+what+it+takes+to+sit+down+and+listen%22&text_class=smart&text_kw0_sel=&text_kw0_must=on&text_kw1_sel=&text_kw1_must=on&text_kw2_sel=&text_kw2_must=on&text_kw3_sel=&text_kw3_must=on&start_date_day=&start_date_month=&start_date_year=&end_date_day=&end_date_month=&end_date_year=&Submit=Submit,https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/quotes-falsely-attributed/,https://richardlangworth.com/quotes-churchill-never-said-1,http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000561,https://archive.org/details/minutespr76newj/page/6,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#43373126352c310327222a2f3a20222f2f26316d202c2e",Did Winston Churchill Say This Quote About Courage?,,,,,

The origin of the quote is unknown but, according to etymologist Barry Popik, the earliest two instances date back to 1958, though the wording varies slightly. It appears in a book written by economist John Kenneth Galbraith, who is often credited with authoring it, and in a periodical where the quote is attributed to reporter Henry Shapiro.

It may actually come from a novel written by editor and novelist Peter De Vries. Fact Check: Hemingway, a Nobel Prize-winning writer, is known for authoring works like “A Farewell to Arms” and “The Old Man and The Sea.” (RELATED: ‘Eat A Live Frog’ – Did Mark Twain Tell People To Do This Every Morning?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though Hemingway did discuss his creative process in interviews, there is no evidence that he ever made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post about writing while intoxicated. The saying also appears nowhere in his collected works or selected letters. “He did not say that. That’s absolutely certain,” said Hemingway biographer Dr. Mary Dearborn in an email to the Daily Caller. “He, along with most writers, made a point of saying he never wrote when drunk.” The expression may actually be a variation of a statement from De Vries’ 1964 novel “Reuben, Reuben,” according to Quote Investigator. De Vries credits one of the book’s character with saying, “Sometimes I write drunk and revise sober, and sometimes I write sober and revise drunk.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Write%20drunk%2C%20edit%20sober.&epa=SEARCH_BOX,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1954/hemingway/biographical/,https://www.britannica.com/topic/A-Farewell-to-Arms-novel,https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Old-Man-and-the-Sea-novel-by-Hemingwayhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Old-Man-and-the-Sea-novel-by-Hemingway,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/16/mark-twain-eat-frog-morning/,https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/ernest-hemingway-the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway,https://books.google.com/books?id=asv3AgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=collected+works+ernest+hemingway&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjayfWY7ZPjAhWPGM0KHdZcBF4Q6AEIKjAA#v=snippet&q=%22edit%20sober%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=iyCMAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=collected+works+ernest+hemingway&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjayfWY7ZPjAhWPGM0KHdZcBF4Q6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20sober%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=SgKeQfmimJEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=ernest+hemingway+selected+letters&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiX_qiKlpTjAhWRslkKHaikAxgQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=%22edit%20sober%22&f=false,https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/205539/ernest-hemingway-by-mary-v-dearborn/9780525563617/,http://www.maryvdearborn.com/index.htm,https://books.google.com/books?id=7dkUBQAAQBAJ&q=sometimes#v=snippet&q=%22write%20drunk%22&f=false,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/09/21/write-drunk/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91e5e3f4e7fee3d1f5f0f8fde8f2f0fdfdf4e3bff2fefc","‘Write Drunk, Edit Sober’ — Did Ernest Hemingway Give This Writing Advice?",,,,,

It does appear in “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein,” a preeminent text on sayings from the theoretical physicist, where it falls under the “Probably Not By Einstein” section. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say, ‘Creativity Is Contagious. Pass It On’?)

Fact Check: Alighieri, simply referred to as Dante, wrote the epic poem “The Divine Comedy,” which details Dante’s journey through hell, purgatory and paradise. However, the quote does not appear in this work or any of his others. (RELATED: Did Plato Say, ‘Be Kind, Everyone You Meet Is Fighting A Hard Battle’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the expression was genuine. “Dante does indeed have it in for those who remained neutral in life,” State University of New York at Geneseo professor Ronald Herzman told the Caller in an email, “but not in those words.” “He placed the morally neutral souls in what has been called the ‘vestibule’ of Hell, and they are there in part, as Dante says, because they did not act, either for good or bad, and contributed nothing to society,” explained University of Wisconsin-Madison professor Christopher Kleinhenz in an email to the Caller. “In short, they are rejected even by Hell and by Heaven, where actions are either punished or rewarded.” The website Quote Investigator traced a variation of the quote, attributed to Dante, back to Henry Powell Spring’s 1944 book of aphorisms, though it used “period” instead of “time.”  Former President John F. Kennedy also attributed a version of the quote to Dante in several of his speeches, according to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. (The library notes, however, that the quote was based on an interpretation of Dante’s “Inferno.”) Several decades earlier, in 1917, a North Carolina newspaper quoted the religious speaker W. M. Vines as saying, “Dante, in his ‘Inferno,’ put those who are neutral in the everlasting fight between right and wrong in the lowest place in hell.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  This statement from Vines was the Christian speaker’s attempt at capturing, in his own words, an idea from Dante’s “The Divine Comedy.” “In conclusion,” Quote Investigator writes, “this quotation did not appear in ‘Inferno’ by Dante Alighieri, and it does not accurately reflect the location of neutral beings in Dante’s elaborate eschatology. Nevertheless, QI conjectures that the statement evolved from a flawed re-interpretation of Dante’s work.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2809219122427793&set=a.523432094339852&type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dante-Alighieri,https://books.google.com/books?id=ISlipJ8yOPMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+divine+comedy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUlpy33JHkAhVIvlkKHeNJBokQ6AEwAXoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=%22hottest%20places%20in%20hell%22&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=ISlipJ8yOPMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+divine+comedy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjUlpy33JHkAhVIvlkKHeNJBokQ6AEwAXoECAYQAg#v=onepage&q=%22hottest%20places%20in%20hell%22&f=false,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/15/fact-check-plato-hard-battle/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/01/14/hottest/,https://www.jfklibrary.org/archives/other-resources/john-f-kennedy-speeches/new-york-ny-senator-lehman-dinner-19581123,https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/life-of-john-f-kennedy/fast-facts-john-f-kennedy/john-f-kennedys-favorite-quotations-dantes-inferno,https://www.newspapers.com/image/57020015/,https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/57019960/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/01/14/hottest/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#80f4f2e5f6eff2c0e4e1e9ecf9e3e1ecece5f2aee3efed","No, This Quote About The ‘Hottest Places In Hell’ Does Not Appear In Dante’s ‘Inferno’",,,,,

Fact Check: Though the House and Senate operate independently on different schedules, Congress is always in session during the same two periods each year. The 114th Congress met for its second session from Jan. 4, 2016, to Jan. 3, 2017.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image, which has been shared on Facebook more than 88,000 times (at the time of publication), alleges that Congress only worked 111 days in 2016 to criticize the work ethic of its legislators. “That means they did not work almost two-thirds of the year,” reads part of the caption. (RELATED: Have Congressional Salaries Gone Up 231 Percent In The Past 30 Years?) However, calendars from the 114th Congress indicate that this claim is inaccurate. The Senate met on a total of 165 days during its second session, with 164 days in 2016 and one in 2017; the House met on 131 days. There were 113 days on which the two chambers were in session together. That isn’t to say legislators don’t work when Congress is not in session. Lawmakers often return to their home states during recesses to meet with constituents and staff, though some choose to stay in D.C. On election years, they may fundraise and campaign for reelection. Their offices in D.C. also remain open.  The 116th Congress, which is currently in its August recess, is set to return from that break Sept. 9.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/742127702474044/photos/a.1027052433981568/2340113626008769/?type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/742127702474044/photos/a.1027052433981568/2340113626008769/?type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/16/fact-check-congressional-salaries-pay-raise-increase-231-past-30-years/,https://congress.gov/past-days-in-session,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CCAL-114scal-2017-01-03/pdf/CCAL-114scal-2017-01-03-pt0.pdf,https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CCAL-114hcal-2017-01-03/pdf/CCAL-114hcal-2017-01-03-pt23.pdf,https://gai.georgetown.edu/congress-out-of-session-does-not-mean-it-isnt-working/,https://www.google.com/search?q=district+work+period&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS850US850&oq=district+work+period&aqs=chrome..69i57.2300j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/congresss-august-recess-turns-into-a-political-cudgel-in-gun-debate/2019/08/09/fcf25b6e-ba19-11e9-b3b4-2bb69e8c4e39_story.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c6b2b4a3b0a9b486a2a7afaabfa5a7aaaaa3b4e8a5a9ab",Did Congress Only Work 111 Days In 2016?,,,,,

(RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, ‘Information Is The Currency Of Democracy’?) Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon has encountered so many quotes falsely attributed to Washington over the years that it keeps a list of “spurious quotations.” The specific statement about the importance of firearms appears on that list. “This quotation does not show up in any of Washington’s writings, nor does any closely related quote,” writes his Mount Vernon estate. Indeed, the Caller searched his writings, as well as his recorded speeches, yet found no matching or similar expressions anywhere.  Quote Investigator, a website that traces the origins of quotations, credits C. S. Wheatley with writing the statement about firearms. The earliest instance of the quote occurs in a 1926 opinion piece Wheatley wrote for an outdoors magazine, where it appears in close proximity to a reference to an address made by Washington. “The passage was composed by C. S. Wheatley and not by George Washington,” writes Quote Investigator. “Unfortunately, the text was misread, and the words were incorrectly attributed to Washington.

Local news coverage shows that Obama’s portrait did not fall off the wall. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Colorado State Capitol Building has portraits of nearly 40 U.S. presidents hanging on the third-floor rotunda. On Aug. 1, state officials and members of the public gathered for the unveiling of Trump’s portrait. This Facebook video, originally posted to Twitter, allegedly captures Obama’s portrait falling off the wall as officials remove the curtain from Trump’s painting. The sound of glass breaking follows shortly afterwards. However, the footage of the unveiling has been manipulated. A video posted by the local CBS affiliate shows that Obama’s portrait remained fixed to the wall during the event. Thomas Peipert, a reporter for The Associated Press who attended the unveiling, also confirmed to the AP that it did not fall. Contributing even more to its dubiousness, none of the people attending the event seem to react to the painting falling off the wall in the Facebook video.

It actually comes from best-selling author Taylor Caldwell’s novel about ancient Rome. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Social media users will often share historical quotes to make points about politics, though some of the quotes they use are not, in fact, genuine. This quote is attributed to Cicero, an orator and politician from the later years of the Roman republic. (RELATED: Did Cicero Issue A ‘Two Thousand Year Old Warning About Trump’?) Though Cicero spoke and wrote prolifically about politics, there is no evidence that he made this statement in 55 B.C. It does not appear in any of his surviving works from that year or any other. “The quote is not by Cicero but from a novel,” Boston University classics professor Dr. Ann Carol Vasaly told the Daily Caller via email. Indeed, the website Quote Investigator traced the origin of the quote to Caldwell’s “A Pillar of Iron,” a historical novel based on Cicero’s life. It appears in a passage summarizing the views of her fictional Cicero character, though the actual Cicero may have agreed with the sentiment.  Although Caldwell can be credited with penning the quote, it was only a year later that others erroneously attributed the quote to Cicero. In 1966, Louisiana Rep. Otto Passman cited Cicero as the author of the statement during an address of Congress. Several institutions, including the Congressional Research Service and University of Texas at Austin, have since called the quote “spurious.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/jenny.l.dubiel/posts/10213939671237837,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cicero,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/05/07/fact-check-cicero-two-thousand-year-old-warning-trump-treason/,https://archive.org/dehttps://archive.org/details/completeworksma00cicegoog/page/n7tails/completeworksma00cicegoog,https://www.bu.edu/classics/faculty-profiles/ann-vasaly/,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/05/15/cicero-budget/,https://books.google.com/books?id=JqMQW69QwgsC&dq=a+pillar+of+iron&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%22tempered+and+controlled%22,https://sites.la.utexas.edu/cicero/myths/,http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000098,https://www.bartleby.com/73/,https://sites.la.utexas.edu/cicero/myths/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a4d0d6c1d2cbd6e4c0c5cdc8ddc7c5c8c8c1d68ac7cbc9",Did Cicero Say This Quote About Ancient Rome?,,,,,

Fact Check: “Over the past 30 years, congressional salaries have gone up 231 percent while 80 percent of Americans haven’t even been able to keep up with the cost of living,” reads the caption. “Now Congress is saying they need a $4,500 raise… For doing WHAT???”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though its claim that 80 percent of Americans are struggling to keep up with the cost of living appears to be correct, according to a CareerBuilder report, the Facebook post exaggerates how much congressional salaries have increased. Non-ranking members of the House and Senate currently make $174,000 per year, according to a Congressional Research Service report. (Ranking members earn higher salaries: House Speaker receives $223,500, Senate president pro tempore receives $193,400 and majority and minority leaders in both chambers receive $193,400.) Prior to 1989, Congress had to enact legislation to increase these salaries. That ended after Congress passed a law authorizing the automatic yearly adjustments they have received since then. (RELATED: Do These Images Show Members Of Congress Sleeping On The Job?) These adjustments are based on changes in private sector wages. Congressional salaries go up if there is a measurable increase in the Employment Cost Index year over year, unless the adjustment is statutorily denied. Congress hasn’t seen a salary increase since 2009, when they first instituted the pay freeze.  Since 1989, the salaries of non-ranking members have increased roughly 94 percent from $89,500 to the current $174,000. When adjusted for inflation, however, they’ve actually gone down in that 30-year period.  That isn’t to say members of Congress haven’t pushed for raising their own salaries in the past 10 years. Some legislators, including House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, advocated for lifting the pay freeze in June.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Under the law authorizing the automatic adjustments, non-ranking members would see a 2.6 percent — or $4,500 — salary increase if the pay freeze was lifted, though the effort to do so has since stalled.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3476921239000800&set=a.901510649875218&type=3&theater,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=3476921239000800&set=a.901510649875218&type=3&theater,https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/most-americans-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/97-1011,https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/senate_salaries.htm,https://pressgallery.house.gov/member-data/salaries,https://www.oge.gov/web/oge.nsf/Authorizing%20Legislation%20and%20Oversight/6FED47DB4CB9B89585257F1C00752BC7/%24FILE/PL101-194.pdf,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/14/fact-check-sleeping-congress/,http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/114_20150106_Salary.pdf,https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/ncs/concepts.htm,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/congressional-pay-2012_n_2197555,https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/97-1011,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/16/politics/congress-pay-raise/index.html,https://www.businessinsider.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-pushing-for-controversial-congressional-raise-2019-6,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/04/congress-pay-raise-1353195,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/16/politics/congress-pay-raise/index.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ef9b9d8a99809daf8b8e8683968c8e83838a9dc18c8082",Have Congressional Salaries Gone Up 231% In The Past 30 Years?,,,,,

Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” Verdict: False The first line of the quote does not appear in any of King’s works, but the other three lines come from his book “Strength to Love.” Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The King Papers Project at Stanford University keeps a comprehensive collection of King’s sermons, correspondence, speeches and other writings. A search of its digital archive turned up no record of King ever saying the first line of the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. Indeed, two King experts, Harvard professor Brandon Terry and University of Washington professor Michael Honey, told the Daily Caller News Foundation in emails that they had never seen it in any of King’s works. The other three lines are original to King, a Baptist minister and a key figure in the Civil Rights movement. They appear in his book “Strength to Love.” King also made thematically similar statements during a 1957 sermon. The earliest appearance of the alleged quote, tracked down by Snopes in 2011, comes from a post by Facebook user Jessica Dovey in reaction to U.S. special forces killing Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.  The first line, however, does not appear in quotation marks in her post, indicating that those words are hers. The other lines are in quotation marks, and they’re correctly attributed to King. “From there, some copies and pastes and reposts later,” wrote Nick Ramsey, a digital producer for MSNBC, in 2011 on the mechanism of the quote’s misattribution. “Those quotation marks somehow disappeared and the entire passage was attributed to Dr. King.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Quote Investigator, a website dedicated to researching the source of quotations, believes the saying attributed to the author of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” actually came from 18th-century French writer Nicolas Chamfort, though the wording varied slightly when translated from its original French. The quote, according to Quote Investigator, was first linked to Twain in 1988, over 70 years after his death.

Fact Check:  Plato and other ancient philosophers are popular targets for spurious quotations, this case included. His work “Republic,” which contains the well-known “Allegory of the Cave,” is widely considered a classic of philosophy. The main character in Plato’s literature is typically Socrates.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in this work, or any of his others, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find any record of the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post.

The website Quote Investigator found no instances of the saying prior to the 19th century, with the earliest known appearance in print dating back to 1898. In that year, according to Quote Investigator, two publications attributed the expression to Scottish minister and author John Watson under his pen name Ian Maclaren, though these instances used “pitiful” instead of “kind.” The saying has also been attributed to Philo of Alexandria, Socrates and Marjorie Pay Hinckley.

Fact Check: Carrey, an award-winning actor who has appeared in films such as “Man on the Moon” and “Bruce Almighty,” has delved into social commentary in recent years, creating political cartoons that express his opinions on current events.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The meme, which has been shared more than 24,000 times, purports that Carrey believes society is collapsing. The alleged statement continues, “People are starting to recognize that the reason they feel like they’re mentally ill is that they’re living in a system that’s not designed to suit the human spirit.” However, Carrey did not say the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. Marleah Leslie, the actor’s publicist, confirmed as much in an email to the Daily Caller, adding, “The quote is actually from Russell Brand from a BBC article.” Indeed, Brand made the statement during a 2017 BBC interview while discussing the topics of mental health and addiction. At the time, he was promoting his book “Recovery: Freedom From Our Addiction,” which was released in October of that year.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/TheoryofExistence/photos/a.982181475253197/1405157826288891/?type=3&theater,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1258970/?ref_=nmawd_awd_nm,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000120/awards?ref_=nm_awd,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125664/,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315327/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_29,https://phi-centre.com/en/event/this-light-never-goes-out-political-cartoons-by-jim-carrey-en/,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/jim-carrey-trump-political-cartoons/index.html,https://www.facebook.com/TheoryofExistence/photos/a.982181475253197/1405157826288891/?type=3&theater,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41652617,https://www.amazon.com/Recovery-Freedom-Addictions-Russell-Brand/dp/1250141923,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3878196859c81b397929a9f8a90929f9f9681dd909c9e","Did Jim Carrey Say, ‘Society Is Collapsing’?",,,,,

Fact Check:  Wilde was a poet, novelist and playwright who featured prominently in the aestheticism movement, in which beauty was considered to be the primary purpose of art. Two of his best known works, the 1895 satirical play “The Importance of Being Earnest” and the 1891 philosophical novel “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” are both considered literary classics.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in these works, or any of his others, does the phrase about happiness appear. A search of his complete works turned up no matching or similar expressions. “I haven’t seen it anywhere in any of Wilde’s published works or his notebooks,” said Sos Eltis, author of “Revising Wilde: Society and Subversion in the Plays of Oscar Wilde,” in an email to the DCNF. “It looks like someone imitating a familiar oppositional structure that Wilde deployed.” The expression, attributed to an anonymous author, appeared below an actual Wilde quote in a 1947 book called “A Little Book of Aphorisms,” according to the website Quote Investigator, though variations of the saying have appeared in print as early as 1908. “One important mechanism for generating misattributions is based on the misreading of neighboring quotations,” explains the website. “One or more inattentive readers of this book may have incorrectly decided that the second statement was crafted by Oscar Wilde.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check:  While Shakespeare authored many famous sayings, this quote on wit does not come from him. It doesn’t appear in the Shakespeare Quartos Archive, an online database of all his plays, or a complete collection of his poems.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Furthermore, scholars told the Daily Caller News Foundation that they do not recognize the expression. “I don’t know where it’s from, but it is not Shakespearean,” said Paul Budra, author of “Shakespeare Early and Late: A Textbook,” in an email to the DCNF. Similar expressions have appeared in print since at least the 1860s, according to the website Quote Investigator, though earlier variations may exist. Writer Abby Buchanan Longstreet included a comparable line in her 1866 novel “Remy St. Remy, or, The Boy in Blue,” which reads, “A battle of wits was to be fought, and the Boy in Blue was unarmed tonight.” (RELATED: ‘Sail Away From The Safe Harbor’ – Did Mark Twain Say This Quote About Taking Chances?)

It actually comes from a poem written by Ella Wheeler Wilcox. Fact Check: Lincoln served as president during the Civil War and is credited with helping abolish slavery in the country.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though the Facebook post attributes the quote to Lincoln, there is no record of him saying it. The statement does not appear anywhere in his collected works. (RELATED: Did Abraham Lincoln Say, ‘It’s Not The Years In Your Life That Count.

It appears in the first few lines of her 1914 poem “Protest.” (The wording differs slightly.) The quote, included on the library’s “Lincoln Never Said That” list, has been falsely attributed to Lincoln since at least the 1950s, when General Douglas MacArthur incorrectly ascribed it to him in a speech to the Massachusetts Legislature.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/doreen.cochran/posts/10214812142201504,https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/abraham-lincoln/,https://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln?type=simple&rgn=full+text&q1=%22sin+by+silence%22&cite1=&cite1restrict=author&cite2=&cite2restrict=author&singlegenre=All&Submit=Search,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/08/09/fact-check-abraham-lincoln-say-years-your-life-count-life-years/,https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RdQSAA0/chandra-manning,https://www2.illinois.gov/alplm/museum/Education/ilhistoryday/Pages/Facsimile.aspx,https://books.google.com/books?id=UNA9AAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=ella+wheeler+wilcox+poems+of+problems&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi-0YKrz_3jAhVsuVkKHVsJCF8Q6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=protest&f=false,https://www2.illinois.gov/alplm/museum/Education/ilhistoryday/Pages/Facsimile.aspx,https://books.google.com/books?id=F-ILUHbWtncC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10&dq=july+25+1951+douglas+macarthur+speech&source=bl&ots=w-0ya-8e3c&sig=ACfU3U3YhfoapSaZoFxiibr6TmLxPdMLvg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiUxbHY7vXjAhXjct8KHXLODQMQ6AEwD3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22To%20sin%20by%20silence%20when%20they%20should%20protest%2C%20makes%20cowards%20of%20men%22&f=false,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#394d4b5c4f564b795d585055405a5855555c4b175a5654","Did Abraham Lincoln Say, ‘To Sin By Silence When They Should Protest, Makes Cowards Of Men’?",,,,,

Fact Check: George Orwell is the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair, a 20th-century English author best known for writing “Nineteen Eighty-Four” and “Animal Farm.” (RELATED: Did George Orwell Say, ‘Telling The Truth Is A Revolutionary Act’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in these works, or any of his others, did the Daily Caller News Foundation find this quote. It does not appear in University College London’s archive of his writings. “Similar sentiments perhaps, but different language,” said Dorian Lynskey, author of “The Ministry of Truth: The Biography of George Orwell’s 1984,” in an email to the DCNF. “There is no evidence of Orwell writing the quoted sentence.” Indeed, Orwell did make thematically similar statements. He wrote an essay in 1942 about writer Rudyard Kipling in which he stated, “[Kipling] sees clearly that men can only be highly civilized while other men, inevitably less civilized, are there to guard and feed them.” In another essay, Orwell included a line with a similar sentiment while discussing pacifists: “Those who ‘abjure’ violence can only do so because others are committing violence on their behalf.”  The website Quote Investigator traced the quote to columnist Richard Grenier’s 1993 article in The Washington Times, where he wrote, “As George Orwell pointed out, people sleep peacefully in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.” Some readers likely mistook Grenier’s attempt at summarizing Orwell’s viewpoint for a direct quotation, even though Grenier’s sentence did not enclose the expression in quotation marks.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “This is a known mechanism for the generation of misattributions,” explained Quote Investigator. “Person A summarizes, condenses, or restates the opinion of Person B.

It’s The Life In Your Years’?2:18 PM 08/09/2019Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsA Facebook post claims that President Abraham Lincoln once said, “It’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The saying does not appear in any of Lincoln’s written works. Fact Check:  Many web pages that post memorable quotes attribute this saying to Lincoln, but The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that he ever made this statement. It does not appear in his collected works. (RELATED: Did Abraham Lincoln Say, ‘The Best Way To Predict The Future Is To Create It’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The saying is also sometimes attributed to United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson II. According to the website Quote Investigator, he used a similar expression in a couple of speeches during the 1950s. “This quote is often misappropriated to Lincoln,” says Daniel Worthington, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln, in an email to TheDCNF. “It actually comes from an advertisement in the Chicago newspaper from 1947.” Indeed, the closest match for the saying appears in an advertisement for Edward Stieglitz’s book on aging in a 1947 edition of the Chicago Tribune, though Quote Investigator found numerous variations of the expression in print as early as 1889. Harold Holzer, a leading scholar on the 16th president, also described the quote as apocryphal.

Verdict: False No credible sources link this statement to Harvey. The statement originally came from an anonymous letter published on a conservative website. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Harvey, a comedian and radio personality, is known for hosting the game show “Family Feud” and the radio program “The Steve Harvey Morning Show.” This Facebook post alleges that Harvey wrote a long statement that praises Trump as “the only guy who seems to understand what the people want” and speaks negatively about politicians and illegal immigrants. The long statement is paired with a photograph of Harvey. However, there is no evidence that Harvey ever made this statement. Though it has been circulating online since at least 2018, an internet search revealed no credible sources linking it to him. The original statement, tracked down by Snopes in March, was posted on the conservative website 100 Percent Fed Up in 2016 as part of an anonymous letter. It was subsequently shared on Facebook by numerous users, including one named Steve Harvey. (This account has no affiliation with the television host.)  Confusion between Harvey and the Facebook user bearing the same name likely spurred the misattribution. Harvey has supported Democratic political candidates in the past, which makes the statement attributed to him more dubious. During the 2016 presidential election, he endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on his radio show. He also supported Democratic candidates in the midterms.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The television host has been vocal about his dislike of Trump in recent years as well, though he did meet with Trump in January 2017 to discuss housing policy. In an October 2018 radio show, Harvey told listeners that he was not a Trump supporter; he called Trump “one of the most immoral presidents” in another.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2114267995367053&set=a.144075569052982&type=3&theater,https://www.familyfeud.com/,https://www.steveharveyfm.com/,https://archive.fo/pBd6g,https://web.archive.org/web/20190510155721/https://100percentfedup.com/dear-rnc-everyday-american-writes-letter-explain-trump-phenomenon/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/steve-harvey-donald-trump/,https://www.facebook.com/steve.harvey.7927/posts/1377850095689888,https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/steve-harvey-hillary-clinton/index.html,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/comedian-steve-harvey-meets-donald-trump-n706751,https://www.instagram.com/p/BpUm62EAK6T/?utm_source=ig_embed,https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=321871521731920&_rdr,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e99d9b8c9f869ba98d888085908a8885858c9bc78a8684",Did Steve Harvey Author This Pro-Trump Statement?,,,,,

Fact Check:  Lennon, in partnership with his bandmate Paul McCartney, wrote countless songs for the Beatles under the songwriting credit “Lennon-McCartney,” including hits like “Come Together” and “In My Life.” He also collaborated with his wife Yoko Ono and pursued a solo career.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, there is no evidence that Lennon, whose music remains popular, wrote the words attributed to him in the Facebook post. It doesn’t appear in any of his lyrics or his three books. The Daily Caller News Foundation also reached out to several experts, none of whom recognized the quote. “I’m almost positive that is not a John Lennon quote,” said Nicole Michael, a spokeswoman for Lennon biographer Jude Southerland Kessler, in an email to the DCNF. “In fact, I think it’s from a Tears for Fears song.” Indeed, a quick Google search reveals the quote does come from a song written by Roland Orzabal, a member of Tears for Fears, and Nicky Holland, a singer-songwriter. Tears for Fears included the song in which the words appear on its 1989 album, “The Seeds of Love.”  The words are in the second verse of their song “Advice for the Young at Heart,” according to the lyric website Genius. The song was released as a single in 1990. The quote has been attributed to Lennon since at least 2010, according to the website Quote Investigator, though there might have been earlier instances.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check:  George Eliot is the pen name of Mary Ann Evans, a prominent female novelist during the Victorian Era. Under this pseudonym, she wrote numerous books, including “Middlemarch” and “Daniel Deronda.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in these works, or any of her others, does the quote attributed to her in the Facebook post appear. TheDCNF searched the George Eliot Archive, an online database of all her writings, as well as her letters, but found no matching expressions. Several experts also told TheDCNF that they did not recognize the quotation, with two noting that it didn’t sound like something she would say. “I don’t recognize it being George Eliot,” said John Burton, chairman of the George Eliot Fellowship, in an email to TheDCNF. “It seems altogether too glib for her.” The website Quote Investigator “tentatively” credits F. O. Hamilton with penning the quote in an essay published by a Pennsylvania newspaper in 1938, though elements of the quote appeared earlier.  “The ascription to George Eliot is unsupported,” reads the post. “The quotation about smiling and frowning appeared adjacent to a statement about the purpose of life in Hamilton’s essay. The latter statement was based on an authentic Eliot quotation.” According to Quote Investigator, the proximity of Hamilton’s statement to a “streamlined” version of a line from Eliot’s “Middlemarch” likely confused readers, leading to the false attribution.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  College of Southern Nevada professor Adam Burgess ascribed a similar mechanism of misattribution to the quote. “The two quotes were further paraphrased in multiple printings of various sources throughout the 1940s and 1950s,” he further explained an email to TheDCNF, “until they became indistinguishable (and because Eliot was the more notable literary figure, her name became the one attached to the quote).” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Did Albert Einstein Coin This Saying On The ‘Definition Of Insanity’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    It does not appear in “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein,” which features more than 1,000 verified Einstein quotes.

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False This quote was actually penned by 2020 presidential candidate and author Marianne Williamson in her debut book. Fact Check: Mandela served as South Africa’s first black president from 1994 to 1999 and helped bring an end to apartheid in the country. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his efforts.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though the Facebook post attributes the quote to Mandela, there is no record of him saying it. The expression appears nowhere in the Nelson Mandela Foundation archive. (RELATED: Did Nelson Mandela Say, ‘Fools Multiply When Wise Men Are Silent’?) Furthermore, the Nelson Mandela Foundation published a statement in 2007, clarifying that the quote actually comes from Williamson, a Democratic presidential candidate. “This quote,” reads the statement, “and especially Williamson’s closing words ‘As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others,’ is often incorrectly credited to Mr. Mandela.” According to the Mandela Foundation, the expression — and the paragraph in which it appears — is sometimes thought to come from Mandela’s 1994 inaugural address, yet it does not appear in any of the three public addresses he gave at the time.  Williamson addressed the misattribution on her website as well, writing, “As honored as I would be had President Mandela quoted my words, indeed he did not. I have no idea where that story came from, but I am gratified that the paragraph has come to mean so much to so many people.” The quote comes from her debut book “A Return to Love.” The book, in which Williamson shares her reflections on love and the 1976 book “A Course in Miracles,” was published in 1992 and spent 39 weeks on The New York Times best-seller list.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/montdorhydepark/photos/a.2250238655265169/2374887172800316/?type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nelson-Mandela,https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1993/mandela/facts/,https://atom.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/informationobject/browse?topLod=0&sort=relevance&query=%22powerful+beyond+measure%22&repos=,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/21/fact-check-nelson-mandela-fools-multiply-wise-men-silent/,https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/deepest-fear-quote-not-mr-mandelas/,https://www.nelsonmandela.org/news/entry/deepest-fear-quote-not-mr-mandelas/,https://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/statement-president-anc-nelson-r-mandela-his-inauguration-president-democratic-republic-sout,https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/nelson-mandela039s-address-people-cape-town-grand-parade-occasion-his-inauguration-state-pre,https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/oath-office-sworn-president-nelson-mandela-his-inauguration,https://web.archive.org/web/20040901005025/http://www.marianne.com/,https://marianne.com/a-return-to-love/,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/07/twenty-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-marianne-williamson/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3a4e485f4c55487a5e5b535643595b56565f4814595557",Viral Quote Attributed To Nelson Mandela Is Actually From Marianne Williamson,,,,,

Fact Check:  Monroe was an award-winning Hollywood actress who starred in several films in the ’50s and ’60s, including “The Seven Year Itch” and “Some Like It Hot.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Throughout her life, she kept notebooks and wrote many poems and letters. Some of these writings were eventually compiled in books like “Fragments” and “MM – Personal.” However, there is no evidence that Monroe ever said or wrote this expression. A search of compilations of her writings turned up no results. It doesn’t appear in her autobiography either. The Daily Caller News Foundation also reached out to multiple experts, none of whom thought the quote was authentic. “I can tell you straight away that it is a fake quote,” said Michelle Morgan, author of “The Girl: Marilyn Monroe, The Seven Year Itch, and the Birth of an Unlikely Feminist,” in an email to the DCNF. “Marilyn certainly did not say this or most of the quotes on the Internet.”  A spokesman from Marilyn Remembered, a long-time Monroe fan club, told the DCNF via email, “It’s definitely a misquote. The Divine Miss M (Bette Midler) actually said it.” The quote, according to the website Quote Investigator, appears to be somewhat similar to a quote from actress and singer Bette Midler.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Quote Investigator reports that this early version of the saying appears in a 1980 newspaper supplement that published fan questions for celebrities together with their answers, including one asking Midler about shoe preferences. “The spike-heeled kind. They’re not always easy to find,” the newspaper quotes Midler as responding. “I firmly believe that with the right footwear one can rule the world.” News outlets, including BuzzFeed and Elle magazine, have included the quote on lists of famous misattributions.

Fact Check: A 19th century English naturalist, Darwin is best known for his theory of evolution. In his 1859 book “On the Origin of Species,” he presented and explained the process of natural selection, whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and reproduce.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in that book, or in any of Darwin’s writings, is the expression to be found. A search of Darwin Online, a database of his collected works, returned no matches. The University of Cambridge’s Darwin Correspondence Project lists a version of this quote on its list of “Six things Darwin never said.” (RELATED: Did Charles Darwin Say, ‘It Is Not The Strongest Or The Most Intelligent Who Will Survive’?) “I am very familiar with this purported quotation. It is of course not by Darwin,” National University of Singapore science historian Dr. John van Wyhe told The Daily Caller in an email. “It is probably a mid-20th century attempt to summarize Darwin’s theory that has been misattributed to Darwin.” Indeed, the earliest appearance of the statement was found in a 1962 history textbook called “Civilization Past and Present,” according to the website Quote Investigator, though it may have appeared in earlier editions. The expression is part of a summary of Darwin’s evolutionary theory by the textbook authors, but is not a direct quote from him or his writings.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/john.a.rubino/posts/2302678466420894,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin,https://www.amazon.com/origin-species-Charles-Darwin-ebook/dp/B008478VE8,https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20selection,https://books.google.com/books?id=tvERAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+origin+of+the+species&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD-vmM8OvjAhXkQd8KHfAyC2IQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22best%20to%20their%20environment%22&f=false,https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/search/?keyword=%22best+to+their+environment%22&tab=,http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/search-results?pagesize=50&sort=date-ascending&pageno=0&freetext=%22best+to+their+environment%22&allfields=&searchid=&name=Darwin+Charles+Robert&dateafter=&datebefore=&searchtitle=&description=&place=&publisher=&periodical=,https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/about/who-we-are,https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/people/about-darwin/six-things-darwin-never-said#quote2,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/07/08/fact-check-charles-darwin-strongest-intelligent-survive-best-manage-change/,http://50.16.190.67/people/van_wyhe.html,https://books.google.com/books?id=vFd0uwEACAAJ&dq=civilization+past+and+present+1962&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5tPTek-DjAhUYuZ4KHUcgDx4Q6AEILjAB,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/12/19/fittest/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#12666077647d605276737b7e6b71737e7e77603c717d7f",Did Charles Darwin Say This Quote About Natural Selection?,,,,,

Handicapped and minority children are too disruptive in the classroom.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Disaster!” the purported tweet continues. “Perhaps not everyone needs K-12 education.” Verdict: False There is no record of the president tweeting this or Education Secretary Betsy DeVos saying it. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The alleged tweet, which is dated to February 14, 2017, in the screen grab, implies that DeVos believes disabled and minority students are “too disruptive in the classroom.” If DeVos made such a statement, however, it would almost certainly have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it. (RELATED: Viral Image Claims That Fox News Isn’t Covering The Mueller Hearings) The Department of Education press secretary Elizabeth Hill confirmed in an email to The Daily Caller that DeVos never said anything to that effect: “Absolutely not. The Secretary never said that. And that’s a fake tweet — not from the president’s account.” There is no evidence that the president ever tweeted this. A search of his Twitter accounts —@realDonaldTrump and @POTUS — turned up no results. ProPublica’s archive of Trump’s deleted tweets also had no record of him tweeting and then deleting it on February 14, 2017, or any other date.  A Facebook group called “Democrats for a Blue America” first posted the fake tweet in February 2017, according to Snopes. (The page has since been deleted.) The original Facebook post, debunked by Snopes in 2017, likely referred to an exchange between DeVos and a Democratic senator during her confirmation hearing regarding the federal law that guarantees free appropriate public education to students with disabilities. When asked whether schools receiving federal funds should be required to meet the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act requirements, DeVos said that the matter was “best left to the states,” though she later said, “federal law must be followed where federal dollars are in play.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2301205339964433&set=a.622735727811411&type=3&theater,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/07/24/fact-check-fox-news-mueller-hearing-coverage-testimony/,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%22disruptive%20in%20the%20classroom%22%22%20(from%3ArealDonaldTrump)&src=typed_query,https://twitter.com/search?q=%22%22disruptive%20in%20the%20classroom%22%22%20(from%3APOTUS)&src=typed_query,https://projects.propublica.org/politwoops/user/POTUS?page=12,https://www.facebook.com/BlueAmerica1/photos/pb.774076136023693.-2207520000.1487169165./1152486788182624/?type=3&theater,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-insult-minorities-disabilities-twitter/,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-insult-minorities-disabilities-twitter/,https://sites.ed.gov/idea/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2017/01/17/betsy-devos-confused-about-federal-law-protecting-students-with-disabilities/?utm_term=.e19b38254f07,https://sites.ed.gov/idea/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eb9f998e9d8499ab8f8a828792888a87878e99c5888486","Did Trump Tweet, ‘Handicapped And Minority Children Are Too Disruptive In the Classroom’?",,,,,

Fact Check:  Kafka, a German-speaking Jewish writer, did not gain prominence for his work until after his death in 1924. He wrote several novels and numerous shorter works, including “The Metamorphosis” and “In the Penal Colony.” However, there is no evidence that Kafka penned the quote attributed to him in the post.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched the Kafka Project, an extensive online archive of Kafka’s work, but found no matching expressions. The quote isn’t present in his collected letters either. It actually originated with a foreword written by Rice for a collection of Kafka’s writings published in 1995, the website Quote Investigator discovered. In the foreword where the quote appears, Rice describes the ways in which Kafka’s writing influenced her own, saying, “Kafka became a model for me, a continuing inspiration.” In 2015, Anne Rice discussed the misattribution on Facebook after Quote Investigator reached out to her. Here’s the post:   “Those are my words struggling to define the impression Kafka’s example made on me! And it’s being attributed worldwide to Kafka,” Rice said in the post. “What a shame. I think Kafka might have expressed those sentiments a lot better!” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: Jefferson is such a popular target for misattribution that his estate at Monticello keeps a list of “spurious quotations.” (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, ‘Democracy Is Nothing More Than Mob Rule’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The quotation appears on that list, along with numerous other sayings falsely attributed to him. “We currently have no evidence to confirm that Thomas Jefferson ever said or wrote, ‘Information is the currency of democracy,’” reads the Monticello website. “The earliest known attribution to Thomas Jefferson (in print) is dated 1987, although this may have happened earlier,” the website continues. “Print sources more commonly attribute this quotation to Ralph Nader.” Nader, a political activist, included the expression unattributed in remarks he made in 1971, later published in The New York Times. Nonetheless, The Daily Caller searched a collection of Jefferson’s quotes and letters, as well as the “Papers of Thomas Jefferson,” but found no record of the expression in either.  John Boles, a retired Rice University professor and Jefferson biographer, told The Caller via email, “No, Jefferson did not say this. It is spuriously attributed to him.” “I have never come across that remark,” confirmed Gordon Wood, author of “Friends Divided: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson,” in an email to The Caller. “But it fits with his sentiments.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Another expert, Robert McDonald of the United States Military Academy, told the Caller in an email that Jefferson had expressed a similar sentiment in an 1816 letter from Jefferson to his contemporary Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours, which reads, “Enlighten the people generally, and tyranny and oppressions of body and mind will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The quote actually comes from a tweet on a parody Twitter account. Fact Check: “Dear America: You are waking up, as Germany once did, to the awareness that 1/3 of your people would kill another 1/3, while 1/3 watches,” reads the alleged quote.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post attributes the statement to Herzog, the award-winning German director behind documentary films such as “Grizzly Man” and “Encounters at the End of the World.” Lucki Stipetic, executive chairman of the Werner Herzog Foundation, told The Daily Caller in an email, “Werner Herzog never made this statement.” A quick Google search reveals the quote actually comes from an August 2017 tweet made by a parody Twitter account called @WernerTwertzog. The account describes itself in its bio as “Werner Herzog’s unpaid internet stooge.” Furthermore, The Caller found no verified Twitter for the filmmaker – and Herzog has told media outlets that he does not have a Twitter account in the past.  “I’m not on social media, but you will find me in the social media,” Herzog told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. “There’s Facebook, there’s Twitters, but it’s all not me. It’s fake Herzogs.” Herzog has spoken about President Donald Trump in the past. According to IndieWire, Herzog said during a talk at the Pratt Institute in 2017, “America is still a democracy and no matter whether you like or dislike the current government or president, America has an amazing ability to rejuvenate itself and to learn and move on. It’s a young country and I don’t see what you call fascism. I think it’s too far fetched.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  In another interview, however, Herzog asked not to discuss politics.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10218319001942183&set=a.1077005361117&type=3&theater,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001348/?ref_=nmawd_awd_nm,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001348/awards,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427312/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1093824/,https://www.wernerherzog.org/en/werner-herzog-stiftung-organe.html,https://twitter.com/WernerTwertzog/status/900382564787122177,https://twitter.com/wernertwertzog?lang=en,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/video/werner-herzog-doesnt-care-people-858852,https://www.indiewire.com/2017/04/werner-herzog-queen-of-the-desert-1201804807/,https://www.newsweek.com/werner-herzog-salt-and-fire-interview-trump-environment-catastrophe-580636,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfbbbdaab9a0bd8fabaea6a3b6acaea3a3aabde1aca0a2",Did Werner Herzog Compare Present-Day America To Nazi Germany?,,,,,

Russell experts say the quote is misattributed. Fact Check:  The Bertrand Russell Archives at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, houses around 130,000 records related to Russell, a philosopher known for his contributions to mathematical logic and analytic philosophy. A search of its digital archive turned up no similar or matching expressions.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Russell published a sizable body of work during his lifetime, including more than 70 books, thousands of essays and numerous letters. The quote, however, does not appear in collections of those either. Andrew Irvine, a Russell scholar at the University of British Columbia, said in an email to TheDCNF: “It is not from Russell.” “It’s not by Russell, though it is often attributed to him because of a book of quotations edited by Laurence Peter, author of ‘The Peter Principle,'” Nicholas Griffin, editor of the “The Cambridge Companion to Bertrand Russell,” told TheDCNF via email. “Not surprisingly, a lot of people took the passage in parenthesis to be by Russell as well. In fact, it is by Peter,” explained Griffin in the email. “What he thought it had to do with Russell actually said, I have no idea. But by now it’s an established misquotation.”  The website Quote Investigator offered a similar account — the proximity of Peter’s parenthetical to a quote attributed to Russell likely caused readers to falsely attribute the parenthetical to Russell as well. Oxford Essential Quotations also attributes the quote to Peter, noting the expression is commentary on a Russell quote yet frequently attributed to him.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  An earlier instance of the quote appears in a 1912 book by Marthe Troly-Curtin, according to Quote Investigator, and Troly-Curtin is who the website “provisionally” credits with the saying.

She met with them again last Monday, including Sheriff Tony Spurlock, who shared a picture of the visit on Twitter.  Thrilled to visit with Ivanka Trump again during her visit to Colorado. Thankful for her support for law enforcement! pic.twitter.com/QRrCHHjPgI — Tony Spurlock (@SheriffSpurlock) July 22, 2019  “Thrilled to visit with Ivanka Trump again during her visit to Colorado,” tweeted Spurlock. “Thankful for her support for law enforcement!”  The Facebook post uses a photoshopped version of this picture to cast Trump in an anti-semitic light. “WTF is she wearing?” reads the caption. “It is like the Trumps are making it normal to be a NAZI.” However, Ivanka converted to Judaism in 2009, the same year that she married her husband Jared Kushner. The couple and their children observe the Sabbath and keep kosher, she told Vogue in an interview.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The logo in the manipulated image likely comes from a political art poster created by Mark Fox and Angie Wang of graphic design company Design is Play.

Orwell Society committee member Leslie Hurst confirmed the misattribution as well, telling TheDCNF in an email, “The quotation, as you suspect, is not from George Orwell.” The website Quote Investigator traced the first attribution of the saying to Orwell – sans the word “universal” – to a 1982 book called “Partners in ecocide: Australia’s complicity in the uranium cartel,” published more than 30 years after his death.

The Churchill Papers, another collection of his writings, had no record of the saying either. Indeed, two experts — John Olsen, the International Churchill Society communications director, and author Gretchen Rubin — confirmed in emails to the Caller that they had not come across the quote in any of Churchill’s works. “I have seen the quote before, but there has never been any correct attribution,” said Olsen. “As far as I know, this quote does not appear anywhere in Churchill’s written or spoken works.”  Lee Pollock, an International Churchill Society trustee, told the Caller in an email, “Not by Churchill … and I would say, doesn’t really even ‘sound like’ him.” Rubin, who wrote “Forty Ways to Look at Winston Churchill,” agreed that the quote didn’t sound like Churchill: “It doesn’t have a Churchillian ring to it, to my ears.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  In a 2018 blog post, Hillsdale College senior fellow and Churchill expert Richard Langworth also identified the quote as misattributed, calling the website linked in the Facebook post a “cornucopia of things Churchill never said.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/groups/thefearlesselephant/permalink/346238246047313/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Winston-Churchill,https://www.nationalchurchillmuseum.org/winston-churchills-speeches.html,https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/writings-articles-and-books/the-books-of-sir-winston-churchill/,http://www.churchillarchive.com/search?advSrchWordsAnd=&advSrchWordsExact=%22behavior+never+lies%22&advSrchWordsOr=&advSrchSearchFromDate=&advSrchSearchToDate=&wordsExclude=&advSrchSource=all&advSrchForm=&recordStats=true,http://www-archives.chu.cam.ac.uk/perl/search?text=%22behavior+never+lies%22&text_class=smart&text_kw0_sel=&text_kw0_must=on&text_kw1_sel=&text_kw1_must=on&text_kw2_sel=&text_kw2_must=on&text_kw3_sel=&text_kw3_must=on&start_date_day=&start_date_month=&start_date_year=&end_date_day=&end_date_month=&end_date_year=&Submit=Submit,https://www.amazon.com/Forty-Ways-Look-Winston-Churchill/dp/0812971442,https://richardlangworth.com/az-quotes-mangles-churchills-words,https://books.google.com/books?id=CAURBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=winston+churchill+collected+works&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigvuOwzNDjAhWkB50JHT48BPcQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&q=winston%20churchill%20collected%20works&f=false,https://richardlangworth.com/about,https://www.azquotes.com/quote/926320?fbclid=IwAR1nuA32nk-T9d-WzFjcFwdYqBKifvpQhPbnA4McBLoDh8glnY10tDu1yVo#.XRfolL9q6uY.facebook,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#077375627168754763666e6b7e64666b6b62752964686a","Did Winston Churchill Say, ‘Behavior Never Lies’?",,,,,

It may actually come from advertising executive Howard W. Newton. Fact Check: An English physicist and mathematician, Newton formulated three laws describing the motion of objects that would eventually form the basis of classical mechanics. He published the three laws of motion, as well as his theory of universal gravity, in the “Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Newton wrote on a variety of subjects during his lifetime, ranging from the motion of the planets to the composition of white light, yet there is no evidence that he authored this saying. A search of the Newton Project archive turned up no results in his texts, notebooks, or correspondence. “Isaac Newton never made such a statement,” said California Institute of Technology professor Mordechai Feingold in an email to The Daily Caller. “It’s often attributed to Howard Newton.” Indeed, website Quote Investigator found the earliest match for the statement in the August 1946 issue of a women’s magazine called Redbook. The quote, which appears in a sidebar along with seven other sayings, appears to have been written by Howard W. Newton.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/ovadia.hayat/posts/10156393370003733,https://www.newton.ac.uk/about/isaac-newton/life,http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/about-us/newton-project,http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/search/results?keyword=tact+is+the+knack&nt1=1&name_text=&cat=&loc=&idno=&sort=relevance&order=desc,http://www.hss.caltech.edu/people/mordechai-feingold,https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/07/18/tact/,https://search-proquest-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/wma/docview/1813163381/B8156AA8E50E4CECPQ/3?accountid=10267,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8cf8fee9fae3fecce8ede5e0f5efede0e0e9fea2efe3e1",Did Isaac Newton Say This Quote About Tact?,,,,,

You never know what you'll learn! Posted by Edventure Hartsville on Monday, July 22, 2019  Verdict: False  This saying does not appear in any of Fuller’s writings. It may actually come from a 1926 list of library slogans. Fact Check:  Fuller, a prominent early feminist writer and editor, wrote the book “Woman in the Nineteenth Century,” which is considered to be an important work in the American feminist movement.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched for the quote in that book, as well as her other works, including letters, poems and memoirs, but found no matching or similar phrases. “I’m not familiar with that in her writings, and, as usual, the internet is confused!” said Chris Highland, author of “Meditations of Margaret Fuller,” in an email to TheDCNF. We consulted with members of the Margaret Fuller Society, who didn’t recognize the expression either, with board member Megan Marshall adding in an email to TheDCNF, “It doesn’t sound like the language of her day.” Quote Investigator, a website dedicating to researching quotes, traced the saying to a 1926 report published in a journal called “The Library,” though elements of the expression appeared earlier. According to the site, the report contained 43 library slogans written for a classroom exercise, with the alleged Fuller quote attributed to a student named W. Fusselman.  The close alphabetical proximity of the names “Fusselman” and “Fuller” in a collection of quotations may have caused the misattribution, Quote Investigator speculated.

Lewis once said, “You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Lewis wrote this expression, which may only date back to the 1980s. Fact Check: In 1982, author James Sherman published a book on how to overcome rejection. “All of us have been rejected more than once. We’ve been turned down for jobs, had applications refused, and lost out in romance,” he wrote.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Sherman advised readers not to fixate on the past, making this observation: “You can’t go back and make a new start, but you can start right now and make a brand new ending.” The excerpt, found by the website Quote Investigator, tracks closely with the quote shared on Facebook. It also happens to be the first known instance of the saying. Though the Facebook post attributes the quote to Lewis, who died in 1963, there is no record of him saying it. “I’m fairly sure that that was not written by Lewis, as it doesn’t quite sound like him, nor have I ever encountered it,” Steve Elmore, vice president of events and communications for the C.S. Lewis Foundation, told The Daily Caller in an email.  The statement appears nowhere in Lewis’ writings, and the attribution has been previously debunked by William O’Flaherty, author of “The Misquotable C.S. Lewis.” The quote reminded Elmore of a section in the book “Mere Christianity” in which Lewis talks about progress: “If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about-turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case, the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsDavid SivakFact Check EditorFollow David on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Posted by Moonrise Festival on Sunday, July 21, 2019  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Sagan coined this saying. It appears to have originated with a 1977 Newsweek profile of him, written by a reporter, not Sagan. Fact Check:  Sagan was an American astronomer and author who worked to popularize science and space exploration amongst the general public. He played an active role in NASA’s space program, including the development of golden plagues for the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes that are meant to communicate information about Earth to extraterrestrial lifeforms, should the probes ever encounter them.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    During his career, Sagan authored books like the Pulitzer Prize-winning “Dragons of Eden,” as well as “Cosmos,” which accompanied the 1980 space documentary series of the same name. The Daily Caller News Foundation searched these and his other works, but did not find the quote ascribed to him in the Facebook post. “The quote – ‘Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known’ is not Carl’s. Carl Sagan never wrote or spoke these words, nor would he,” Pam Abbey of Druyan-Sagan Associates, the company that retains copyrights and trademarks for Sagan and his wife, told TheDCNF in an email. “They were actually written by a Newsweek reporter doing a profile on him in 1977,” continued Abbey. “Dr. Sagan was not impressed with the ‘incredible,’ a word he held in low regard. He was much more interested in discovering the ‘credible.'” Indeed, the website Quote Investigator traced the origin of the expression back to a 1977 profile of Sagan in Newsweek magazine, where it appeared without quotation marks.  Sharon Begley, one of the authors of the piece, confirmed in an email to TheDCNF that the saying was her own writing, not a quote from Sagan.

Fact Check:  The internet is replete with Churchill quotes, both genuine and misattributed. This quote about optimism appears to fall in the latter category. (RELATED: Did Winston Churchill Say, ‘Attitude Is A Little Thing That Makes A Big Difference’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    TheDCNF searched for the phrase in the complete works of Churchill, as well as the Churchill Archive, a digital database that contains around 800,000 pages of original documents associated with the prime minister, but found no matches. “The quote is often attributed to Churchill, but there is no known documentation to show that he ever said or wrote it,” confirmed David Freeman, director of publications at the International Churchill Society, in an email to TheDCNF. A number of other Churchill experts – Timothy Riley, Lee Pollock and Richard Langworth – concurred with Freeman’s assessment of it being falsely attributed, but some added that it sounded like something Churchill would say. “A nice phrase with a Churchillian ring – but not attributable to him,” said Pollock, an International Churchill Society trustee, in an email to TheDCNF.  Riley, director and chief curator of the National Churchill Museum, told TheDCNF, “The rather upbeat sentiment is certainly Churchillian, however, and recalls a quip he made in a 9 November 1954 speech at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet in London.” Langworth and Pollock also pointed to that same 1954 speech in which Churchill said, “For myself I am an optimist – it does not seem to be much use being anything else.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The website Quote Investigator traced the origin of the quote to a 1919 speech by Bertram Carr, the then-mayor of Carlisle, England, though elements of the quote appeared earlier. The portion of the speech containing the statement reads as follows: “The past history of an old walled city such as this leaves its legacy of ideas antiquated and out of date. These, as expressed in tangible form, are an embarrassment, and hinder the wheels of progress, but we view these, I hope, in the spirit of the optimist to whom every difficulty is an opportunity, and not as the pessimist, to whom every opportunity presents some difficulty.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Verdict: False Individuals must be present in the U.S. or at a port of entry to apply for asylum. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The U.S. maintains one embassy and nine consulates in Mexico. The embassy is located in the nation’s capital of Mexico City, while consulates can be found in Ciudad Juarez, Guadalajara, Hermosillo, Matamoros, Merida, Monterrey, Nogales, Nuevo Laredo and Tijuana. The Facebook post claims that people can apply for asylum at these diplomatic facilities without the risk of being separated from their children, as many families who crossed the border illegally have experienced in recent years. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services explains on its website that individuals can apply for asylum if they are present in the U.S. or at a port of entry, a checkpoint where authorized persons may be admitted into the country legally. However, asylum cannot be claimed at embassies or consulates. “The United States does not grant asylum in its diplomatic premises abroad,” the U.S. embassy and consulate in Poland state online. Immigrants can apply for asylum regardless of their immigration status, so long as they have been in the country less than a year and are not currently in removal proceedings.  Although many illegal immigrants cross at the U.S.-Mexico border, many of them are not from Mexico. The majority of border crossers come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. These immigrants often travel through Mexico to claim asylum in the U.S. (RELATED: What Percentage Of Asylum Claims Are Denied?) Last week, the Trump administration moved forward with a “third country” rule that will dramatically reduce the ability of Central American migrants to seek asylum. Under the interim final rule, migrants who pass through a third country on their way to the U.S.-Mexico border will be ineligible for asylum unless they applied for protected status in that third country first.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The move has since been challenged in federal court by the American Civil Liberties Union, Southern Poverty Law Center and Center for Constitutional Rights.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2420943531316020&set=a.398520686891658&type=3&theater,https://mx.usembassy.gov/,https://mx.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/embassy/,https://mx.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/us/family-separation-trump-administration.html,https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-asylum-eligibility-and-applications,https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/Assets/2015/02/BorderEnforcement_Brief_web.pdf,https://it.usembassy.gov/embassy-consulates/rome/sections-offices/dhs/uscis/refugeesasylum/,https://pl.usembassy.gov/visas/politica-asylum-and-refugees/,https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/asylum/questions-and-answers-asylum-eligibility-and-applications,https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1107056/download,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-restricted-flow-border-more-migrants-trying-sneak-through-undetected-n976356,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/06/29/fact-check-80-percent-asylum/,https://www.dhs.gov/news/2019/07/15/dhs-and-doj-issue-third-country-asylum-rule,https://www.npr.org/2019/07/15/741769333/u-s-sets-new-asylum-rule-telling-potential-refugees-to-apply-elsewhere,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-prepares-new-rule-for-asylum-seekers-at-southern-border-11563195494,https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/16/2019-15246/asylum-eligibility-and-procedural-modifications,https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/groups-file-federal-lawsuit-challenging-new-trump-asylum-restrictions,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#72060017041d003216131b1e0b11131e1e17005c111d1f",Can Non-Citizens Apply For Asylum At A US Embassy?,,,,,

Verdict: False Fox News coverage began at 8 a.m. Wednesday and will continue into primetime. The network started airing promos for it days before the testimony. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Mueller agreed to testify before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees in back-to-back hearings Wednesday on the Russia investigation. In a 448-page report, which Mueller submitted to Attorney General William Barr in March, the special counsel detailed the findings of his nearly two-year probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. It did not establish that President Donald Trump coordinated or conspired with the Russian government, but left open the question of whether the president obstructed justice. A viral image falsely alleged in a post that Fox News would not broadcast Mueller’s testimony about the report, despite Fox News advertising that it would. When reached for comment, Fox News pointed to a promotion that ran in the days leading up to the coverage. Its website also prominently features a box in the upper corner of the homepage that links to the live stream.  According a press release published Monday, Fox News’ coverage would start around 8 a.m. with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum co-anchoring. The network’s primetime lineup would then follow up that coverage with analysis in the evening. The claim originated with a tweet posted by MSNBC contributor Joyce Vance. This tweet, which has since been deleted, read, “Fox isn’t showing Mueller’s testimony Wednesday. Trump is afraid of what will happen if his base gets to hear Mueller’s testimony for themselves.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  A day later, GOP strategist Rick Wilson made a similar claim on MSNBC’s “Deadline: White House,” hosted by Nicolle Wallace. Both subsequently issued corrections on Twitter, with Vance saying, “I’ve deleted an earlier tweet I intended ironically, but that some took as factual regarding Fox news coverage of Mueller’s testimony.” Wilson tweeted on Monday, “I stand corrected: Fox apparently will cover the Mueller hearings. The MAGA Javerts were all aflutter.” Other well-known Twitter users perpetuated the viral claim, including author Stephen King and Los Angeles Times columnist David Lazarus.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: This expression has multiple variations. In a 2009 book, the management consultant Peter Drucker was quoted as saying, “You cannot predict the future, but you can create it.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Ilya Prigogine, recipient of the 1977 Nobel Prize in chemistry, apparently said, “The way to cope with the future is to create it.” The website Quote Investigator has tracked down these and other variations of the phrase, none of which credibly belong to the nation’s 16th president. The statement appears nowhere in his collected writings, according to Daniel Worthington, director of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln. “I am not familiar with the quote, and I could not find it in any of our documents, so I have my doubts Lincoln said it,” he told The Daily Caller in an email. The saying may have originated with Dennis Gabor, the physicist who won the 1971 Nobel Prize for inventing holography. “The future cannot be predicted, but futures can be invented,” he wrote in a 1963 book. “It was man’s ability to invent which has made human society what it is.”  Alan Kay, the former chief scientist of Atari, is credited with the particular wording found in the Facebook post.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsDavid SivakFact Check EditorFollow David on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The Ellis Island Honors Society (EIHS) recognizes Americans from a variety of ethnic backgrounds who exemplify the country’s values and ideals. Past recipients of the medal include U.S. presidents, Nobel laureates, Supreme Court justices and civil rights activists. Trump was among the first 80 honorees to receive the award in 1986, along with Rosa Parks, the iconic civil rights activist, and Muhammad Ali, the professional boxer. However, the award is rarely given for specific achievements. The Daily Caller confirmed this via email with Otto Coca, the communications director of EIHS, who said, “Like many of our medalists, it’s not what they did, but what they symbolize.”  “Rosa Parks received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor for her personification of the American spirit when faced with injustice,” he explained. “The centerpiece of her distinction is that she faced discrimination and fought it in a uniquely American way.” Ali earned his award for “his personification of integrity and exercise of literal strength while combating discrimination,” according to Coca.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  He also cited Trump’s success as a real estate developer in New York City and his German heritage – not contributions to the black community – as the basis for his award during in a phone interview with the Caller.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”    googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });    “Do not follow where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail” – Ralph Waldo Emerson #TravelInspiration #TravelTuesday Posted by Pentravel on Tuesday, July 16, 2019  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Emerson ever penned this phrase. It may be a variation of a line written by poet Muriel Strode. Fact Check: Emerson was a philosopher, poet and essayist who featured prominently in the 19th century transcendentalist movement that emphasized intuitive, spiritual thinking over scientific, empirical thinking. He published a sizable body of work during his lifetime, including the well-known essay “Self-Reliance.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched a complete collection of his works, as well as his personal letters, for similar or matching phrases. However, the searches turned up no statements resembling the one attributed to Emerson in the Facebook post. “That quote does not appear in Emerson’s works. It is a false attribution,” confirmed a spokesperson for the Ralph Waldo Emerson Society in an email to TheDCNF. “It is definitely not an Emerson quotation, although it is attributed to him all over the Internet,” Jeffrey Cramer, editor of “The Portable Emerson,” said via email to TheDCNF. “I haven’t been able to track down its origin.” Quote Investigator, a website dedicated to researching the sources of quotations, traced a variation of the phrase back to the 1903 poem “Wind-Wafted Wild Flowers,” written by Strode. The opening line of the poem reads as follows: “I will not follow where the path may lead, but I will go where there is no path, and I will leave a trail.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

My life has the tendency to fall apart when I’m awake, you know?”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Hemingway wrote this quote. Two Hemingway biographers also doubt its authenticity. Fact Check: Throughout his writing career, Hemingway penned numerous short stories and novels, including classics like “The Old Man and the Sea” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Hemingway does talk about sleep several times in his personal letters, usually in the context of having trouble sleeping. In one letter, for example, he tells fellow author F. Scott Fitzgerald about his insomnia; in another he talks about taking sleeping pills. “Like many ‘sensitive’ types he had trouble with insomnia (when he wasn’t dead drunk),” Mary V. Dearborn, author of “Ernest Hemingway: A Biography,” said in an email to TheDCNF. However, TheDCNF could not find any evidence that Hemingway said or wrote this quote. Searching collections of his novels, poems and short stories failed to return any matching or similar phrases. “It’s definitely not Hemingway. This is the first time I’ve heard the quote,” Dearborn said. “The syntax or diction is wrong. Hemingway would never make an observation and then end it with ‘you know?’ He wasn’t that friendly, and he wasn’t all that interested in whether someone got what he was saying or not. So just no on all counts.”  Another biographer, James Hutchisson, shared a similar sentiment in an email to TheDCNF: “Most likely not by Hemingway.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Fact Check: In November 2017, Trump traveled to Missouri to deliver remarks on tax reform at a convention center just outside of St. Louis. It was at that event more than a year ago that the president pointed to a red placard on stage.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Contrary to what the meme claims, the sign did not encourage people who dislike America to leave the country. It actually had a much kinder sentiment, simply reading, “Merry Christmas.” The original image, which The Daily Caller found through a reverse image search, comes from a Reuters photographer. Internet users have manipulated the words on the placard to express different sentiments in the past. For example, one photoshopped version makes it quote “Gucci Gang,” a popular rap song from 2017. The doctored image derives its message from comments Trump reportedly made about Haiti and some African countries last year. Trump allegedly referred to those nations as “s***hole countries” during a meeting with senators. The U.N. human rights office condemned the language, saying the remark was “racist” if true.  Trump came under fire last week for suggesting that a group of progressive congresswomen “go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.” The tweet was widely believed to refer to Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, all of whom are U.S. citizens and, with the exception of Omar, were born in the U.S. The Democrat-led House passed a resolution July 16 condemning his tweets as “racist comments that have legitimized increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Trump responded to the vote, saying over Twitter, “Those Tweets were NOT Racist.

Fact Check:  Da Vinci, creator of the “Mona Lisa” and other famous Renaissance works, was more than just a painter; he was also a scientist, inventor and military engineer.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    He left voluminous notebooks filled with sketches, scientific observations and musings on the natural world. But nowhere in these notebooks, which were edited and translated by German art scholar Jean Paul Richter, is the quote ascribed to him in the Facebook post to be found. “I’m very suspicious of it because I’ve never seen anything like it in Leonardo’s writings,” Ross King, author of “Leonardo and the Last Supper,” said in an email to TheDCNF. “I did a search in scanned copies of both vols. 1 and 2 … and neither ‘simplicity’ nor ‘sophistication’ appears in either; and even the word ‘simple’ doesn’t appear in any context where it’s juxtaposed to complexity. These facts, in my view, disqualify the quote, because it’s very difficult to imagine where it would have come from if not the Richter edition.” The website Quote Investigator also found no evidence that da Vinci authored the quote. It traced a version of the phrase to the 1931 book “Stuffed Shirts” by Clare Boothe Luce. A character in the novel at one point states, “I have resolved to grow old, naturally and gracefully, content in the knowledge that the greatest intellects are the homeliest ones, and that the height of sophistication is simplicity.” The phrase, as written in the Facebook post, was also featured without attribution in a 1977 Apple computer brochure.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, “Private truck drivers are destroying America.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “They get like four miles to the gallon, they think they own the road and they throw bottles of pee out their windows so they can keep driving. It’s a barbaric industry,” the quote continues. “Trucks should all be government regulated and drivers should be on full-time camera until we can figure out how to automate our shipping and do away with them altogether.” Verdict: False Ocasio-Cortez has never made this statement. It comes from an article published on a satire website. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman congresswoman from New York, sponsored a House resolution called the Green New Deal in February. It proposes large-scale changes to current economic and environmental policies, including a call for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. (RELATED: Does Ocasio-Cortez Want To Repeal Daylight Saving Time To Combat Climate Change?) While the Green New Deal does propose an overhaul to the transportation sector, particularly in the context of reducing emissions, it does not include any language that specifically discusses the trucking industry. The Daily Caller did not find any news reports in which the quote appears, and resources like the congressional record turned up no matches either.

It may be a version of an expression written by American fantasy author P.C. Hodgell. Fact Check: An award-winning astronomer and popular science writer, Sagan helped establish, among other scientific contributions, that a strong “greenhouse effect” likely caused the high temperatures experienced on Venus today.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Sagan is perhaps best known for writing and hosting the 1980 space documentary series “Cosmos: A Personal Voyage.” The Emmy Award-winning series explored topics ranging from the origins of the universe to the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

Scott Fitzgerald Posted by Reason with Logic on Tuesday, July 9, 2019  “I hope you live a life you’re proud of, and if you find that you’re not, I hope you have the strength to start over,” the quote continues. Verdict: False There is no evidence that Fitzgerald ever said or wrote this quote. It appears to have originated with the 2008 movie “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” a film based on Fitzgerald’s short story of the same name. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Fitzgerald, one of the most influential American writers of the 20th century, is best known for his portrayals of the Jazz Age in America, having written acclaimed books like “The Great Gatsby.” However, nowhere in this book, or any of his other writings, did The Daily Caller News Foundation find the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. Several Fitzgerald scholars, including Kirk Curnutt, David S. Brown and Thomas Birch, said in emails to TheDCNF that they did not recognize the quotation. Brown, author of “Paradise Lost: A Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald,” believes the quote originated with the 2008 movie “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” a film loosely based on Fitzgerald’s short story of the same name. At one point in the movie, actor Brad Pitt, playing the title character, goes into a short monologue:  “For what it’s worth: it’s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There’s no time limit, start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of. And if you find that you’re not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again.” The quote featured in the Facebook post roughly combines the beginning and end of this monologue, which appears to be a creation of the film’s screenwriter, Eric Roth, as it is not found in Fitzgerald’s short story.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Lewis Posted by Leonie Dawson on Tuesday, July 9, 2019  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Lewis ever said or wrote this statement. Fact Check: Lewis, one of the most renowned authors and theologians of the 20th century, is well known for fiction like “The Chronicles of Narnia,” as well as his musings on Christianity, including “The Problem of Pain.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though he is frequently quoted on the internet, there is no evidence that Lewis said or wrote the phrase attributed to him in the Facebook post. Michael Ward, a Lewis expert and author of “The Narnia Code: C.S. Lewis and the Secret of the Seven Heavens,” told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an email that the quote is not genuine. It does not appear in “The Quotable Lewis,” a book that contains more than 1,500 verified quotes from the writer, or any of his writings. The C.S. Lewis Foundation features the quote on a section of its website titled “Quotes Misattributed to C.S. Lewis.” The foundation credits motivational speaker Les Brown with coining the expression. The website Quote Investigator agrees, tracing it back to his 1992 book “Live Your Dreams.” Lewis did once write about goals, saying, “Progress means getting nearer to a desired goal and therefore means not being there already. You don’t want the London train to go on progressing after it reached London!”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It may be a version of a statement written about him by Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud. Fact Check: An artist, scientist and inventor, da Vinci was one of the most celebrated figures of the Italian Renaissance period. His best known paintings include the “Mona Lisa,” the “Last Supper” and “Lady with an Ermine.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though da Vinci took thousands of pages of notes over the course of his career, there is no reason to believe he authored the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The statement appears nowhere in his writings. “About 80% of the Leo ‘quotes’ on the internet are not by him. This is not amongst the 20%,” Trinity College art historian and da Vinci expert Martin Kemp told The Daily Caller in an email.  The quote appears to be a version of a comment made about da Vinci in Freud’s 1910 essay “Leonardo da Vinci: A Memory of His Childhood.” “In Merezhkovsky’s admirable simile, he was like a man who had awoken too early in the darkness, while everyone else was still asleep,” Freud wrote, crediting Russian author Dmitry Merezhkovsky with the imagery.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonardo-da-Vinci,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sigmund-Freud,https://www.history.com/topics/renaissance/italian-renaissance,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/whats-so-special-about-the-mona-lisa/index.html,https://www.britannica.com/topic/Last-Supper-fresco-by-Leonardo-da-Vinci,https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-leonardo-da-vinci-woman-with-an-ermine-20140930-story.html,https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/leonardo-da-vinci-notebook,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/feb/12/leonardo-da-vinci-notebooks-art,https://books.google.com/books?id=L1UpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA15&dq=leonardo+da+vinci+writings&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjWs4it1rnjAhVZCM0KHYkyB-A4ChDoAQg5MAM#v=onepage&q=sleep&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=kYs-DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=leonardo+da+vinci+writings&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVr_yD1rnjAhWXbs0KHf9eBbcQ6AEIRzAF#v=onepage&q=sleep&f=false,http://www.martinjkemp.com/welcome.html,https://books.google.com/books?id=4MZnpQZqNYAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=leonardo+da+vinci+and+a+memory+of+his+childhood&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjp4IiG57fjAhVQOq0KHSgWCoQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dmitry-Sergeyevich-Merezhkovsky,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9aeee8ffecf5e8dafefbf3f6e3f9fbf6f6ffe8b4f9f5f7","Did Da Vinci Say, ‘I Awoke, Only To Find That The Rest Of The World Was Still Asleep’?",,,,,

Fact Check: The Medal of Freedom is the most prestigious civilian award presented by a U.S. president. During his presidency, Obama awarded the medal to more than 110 recipients.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Facebook post in question criticizes Democrats for allegedly awarding the medal to Clinton, Cosby, Weiner and Weinstein, who have each been accused or convicted of sexual misconduct. “I didn’t know there was a sexual predator award,” the caption remarks. Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998 for lying under oath and for obstruction of justice, both charges arising out of a sexual harassment lawsuit brought against him by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. The Senate subsequently acquitted Clinton on both articles of impeachment. In 2017, Weiner was convicted of transferring obscene material to a minor and sentenced to 21 months in prison. He was released from federal custody a few months early in May. Cosby was convicted in 2018 of aggravated indecent assault and sentenced to three to 10 years in prison. He remains incarcerated. Weinstein, on the other hand, is currently awaiting trial after being charged in 2018 with several counts of sexual assault and rape.  Though Obama awarded the Medal of Freedom to Clinton in 2013, he never awarded it to Cosby, Weiner or Weinstein, contrary to the claims of the Facebook post. Neither Weinstein nor Weiner has ever received the medal, while Cosby was given the award in 2002 by former President George W. Bush. (RELATED: Did Obama Bow To The Supreme Leader Of Iran?) In the Facebook image, the heads of Cosby, Weinstein and Weiner have been photoshopped onto photographs of Obama presenting the Medal of Freedom to different public figures. A photo of Cosby’s head appears to have been photoshopped onto a 2016 image of musician Bruce Springsteen. Images of Weinstein’s and Weiner’s heads seem to have been superimposed onto a 2017 photo of former Vice President Joe Biden and a 2016 photo of actor Tom Hanks, respectively.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Despite his sexual assault conviction, which he appealed in June, Cosby has not been stripped of the Medal of Freedom. “There is no precedent for revoking a medal,” Obama said after being asked about the allegations in 2015, before Cosby was convicted. “We don’t have that mechanism.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/tapstrueamericanpatriot/posts/2769156159783850,https://www.whitehouse.gov/medaloffreedom/,https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/campaign/medal-of-freedom,https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-2/section-4/the-clinton-impeachment,https://www.politico.com/story/2018/11/14/clinton-settles-sexual-harassment-suit-1998-983371,https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/president-clinton-impeached,https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/articles122098.htm,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/anthony-weiner-sentenced-to-21-months-in-federal-prison/2017/09/25/ad4165f4-a1f4-11e7-ade1-76d061d56efa_story.html,https://www.google.com/search?q=anthony+weiner+sentenced&oq=anthony+weiner+sentenced&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3.5433j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/nyregion/anthony-weiner-prison-release.html,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bill-cosby-convicted-on-three-counts-of-sexual-assault/2018/04/26/d740ef22-4885-11e8-827e-190efaf1f1ee_story.html,https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/25/us/bill-cosby-sentence-assault/index.html,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bill-cosby-birthday-prison-bible-quote,https://qz.com/quartzy/1628139/harvey-weinstein-could-still-go-to-jail/,https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/02/us/harvey-weinstein-charges/index.html,https://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/barack-obama-bill-clinton-oprah-medal-of-freedom-100135,https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/07/20020709-8.html,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/05/22/fact-check-obama-bow-supreme-leader-iran/,https://www.vulture.com/2016/11/watch-bruce-springsteen-get-his-medal-of-freedom.html,https://www.npr.org/2017/01/12/509545778/in-surprise-send-off-president-obama-awards-biden-presidential-medal-of-freedom,https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-last-time-obama-awards-prez-medals-to-gates-ellen-degeneres-tom-hanks/story-8aA1lzmluc2RcX5kYe8LSO.html,https://abcnews.go.com/US/bill-cosby-appeals-sex-assault-conviction-grounds-additional/story?id=63942411,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu7sq5qZQVU,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9eeaecfbe8f1ecdefafff7f2e7fdfff2f2fbecb0fdf1f3","Did Obama Award The Presidential Medal Of Freedom To Clinton, Cosby, Weiner And Weinstein?",,,,,

Fact Check: Perot, a billionaire businessman who ran for president twice on a third-party platform, died from leukemia last Tuesday.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Perot made his money in information technology, with much of his fortune coming from the two companies he founded and sold, one to General Motors and another to Dell. Forbes estimated his net worth to be $4.1 billion in 2019. Aside from his lucrative business ventures, Perot was well-known for the two independent presidential runs he made in the ’90s. A key feature of his campaigns was 30-minute political infomercials in which he discussed the economy, jobs and the national debt. At least one member of the Perot family has engaged in politics through donations. According to FEC records, the late billionaire’s son donated $5,600 to Trump in March. There’s no evidence, however, that Perot left $100 million to Trump’s campaign in his will. Had he done so, it would have been picked up by major media outlets, yet none have reported on it. The family also did not mention anything to that effect in its statement to the media, nor has it put anything on the memorial website.  A big donation received in such a manner would likely prompt a statement – or at least a tweet – from Trump’s camp as well. The claim comes from an article published on PotatriotsUnite.com, a parody news website dedicated to “parody, satire, and tomfoolery, or as Snopes calls it: Junk News.” The article, which put up the headline “Ross Perot Left $100 Million to the Trump 2020 Campaign,” is satirical in nature and should not be treated as fact.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Democrats did not vote on whether to alter or deny the adjustment for 2019. Fact Check: The Social Security Administration (SSA) distributes benefits to well over 60 million Americans each month, using annual COLAs to keep the value of those benefits from being eroded by inflation.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Prior to 1975, Congress had to enact legislation to increase these benefits. That ended after President Richard Nixon signed a law authorizing the automatic yearly adjustments received today. These adjustments are based on the change in consumer prices for a basket of goods and services purchased by urban wage earners and clerical workers. Benefits go up if there is a measurable increase in the index year over year; otherwise, there is no adjustment. The SSA announced a 2.8 percent increase for 2019, the largest annual adjustment since 2012 and likely the source of the percentage cited by the meme. In recent years, COLAs have been smaller – there was a 2 percent increase in 2018, 0.3 percent in 2017 and no adjustment at all in 2016. However, Congress did not vote on any of these adjustments. “There have been no House votes in recent sessions of Congress on Social Security COLAs or other one-time payment increases,” Erin Hatch, press secretary for Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee, told The Daily Caller in an email. “The COLA for this year is 2.8 percent, but this came from an automatic adjustment set in law, not from a vote.”  There have also been no recent votes to deny Social Security COLAs in the Senate. That isn’t to say there hasn’t been legislation introduced to change the adjustments seniors receive. Rep. John Larson of Connecticut introduced the Social Security 2100 Act earlier this year.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The bill proposes a benefit increase of about 2 percent of the average benefit.

Fact Check:  “There must be continued propaganda abroad to undermine the loyalty of citizens in general, and teenagers in particular,” the statement continues. “By making drugs of various kinds readily available, by creating the necessary attitude of chaos, idleness and worthlessness, and by preparing him psychologically and politically, we can succeed.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    An internet search revealed that the quote has been attributed to several Soviet-era figures, including Lenin, dictator Joseph Stalin and Stalin’s secret police chief Lavrentiy Beria. However, a search of the Marxist Internet Archive, an online database of the writings of various influential Marxists, turned up no instances where this statement appears. (RELATED: Did Vladimir Lenin Say ‘Socialized Medicine Is The Keystone To The Arch Of A Socialist State’?) The 1989 book “They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, and Misleading Attributions” discusses this and a second, unrelated quote, both attributed to Beria. “The Beria statement about teen-agers was popular among ultra-rightists in the 1960s but just as phony,” reads the book. “There is no record of any speech made by Beria in which either statement appears.” Multiple Lenin experts also dismissed the notion that he ever said the quote. “The content of the quote goes completely against Lenin’s ideas,” Christopher Read, a professor at the University of Warwick and author of “Lenin: A Revolutionary Life,” told TheDCNF. In an email to TheDCNF, Andy Blunden, an administrator for the Marxist Internet Archive, described the statement as “a blindingly obvious right-wing invention.”  Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The meme alleges that Russian journalists, by contrast, were allowed in the room.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Well sure. Putin knows his media will only say what he tells them to say, and Trump knows our media will tell THE TRUTH,” reads the meme. “He can’t let that happen!” Verdict: False A standard contingent of American journalists was present before the bilateral meeting between Trump and Putin, according to a member of the press pool who attended. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Trump and Putin met during the 14th G20 summit, a forum for the leaders of 19 countries and the European Union that collectively make up nearly 75 percent of global trade. The 2019 summit, held in Osaka, Japan, focused on themes including innovation and women’s empowerment. The two leaders last held a formal meeting in July 2018 at a summit in Helsinki, Finland. The meeting in Osaka received attention after Trump jokingly urged Putin not to meddle in the 2020 election in response to a journalist who asked if Trump would press him on that issue. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show Trump Jr. With Alleged Russian Spy Maria Butina?) According to news reporting and video from the event, Trump and Putin held an introductory portion of the meeting with journalists present, hence the questions from reporters, and a second portion with senior aides behind closed doors. “US and Russian reporters were both present for the brief pool spray before the Trump-Putin bilat,” New York Times White House correspondent Michael Crowley, who attended the event, told The Daily Caller in an email.  The Caller found no evidence that Russian journalists were allowed in the room to the exclusion of American journalists, contrary to the claims of the Facebook post. At the summit, Trump also met individually with leaders including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Trump traveled to the Korean Peninsula afterwards to meet with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to visit North Korea.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/DemocratsOrganizingForAmerica/photos/a.100717470085321/1303089329848123/?type=3&theater,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-putin-meet-g20-summit-japan-today-2019-06-28/,https://g20.org/en/,http://g20.org.tr/about-g20/g20-members/,https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/group-twenty,https://g20.org/en/summit/theme/,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/15/us/politics/trump-putin-meetings-phone-calls.html,https://www.vox.com/2018/7/16/17576956/transcript-putin-trump-russia-helsinki-press-conference,https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/russian-president-vladimir-putin-and-us-president-donald-news-photo/1152460917,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/27/donald-trump-tells-putin-playfully-dont-meddle-election/1581694001/,https://checkyourfact.com/2018/12/14/fact-check-photo-donald-trump-jr-spy-maria-butina/,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-putin-meet-g20-summit-japan-today-2019-06-28/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br-p2Pe9fcY,https://twitter.com/michaelcrowley?lang=en,https://www.reuters.com/article/g20-summit-trump-bilaterals/at-g20-trump-to-hold-at-least-eight-side-bilateral-meetings-idUSW1N22K02E,https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-prime-minister-abe-japan-bilateral-meeting-7/,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/trump-embraces-modi-despite-disputes-with-india-in-message-to-china,https://www.c-span.org/video/?462158-1/president-trump-german-chancellor-merkel-20-summit,https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-meeting-dmz-sunday-2019-06-30/,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cbbfb9aebda4b98bafaaa2a7b2a8aaa7a7aeb9e5a8a4a6",Were American Journalists Barred From Trump and Putin’s G20 Meeting?,,,,,

The California senator provided Mercury News with an undated photograph of her parents in February. Neither of them are pictured in the meme, as its caption claims. India-West, an Indian news outlet based in America, included the meme’s picture in an article about Harris getting elected to the Senate in 2016. Its caption revealed the identities of the couple and event captured by the photograph. The image comes from a 2016 fundraising gala thrown by Pratham USA, an Indian charitable organization.

The quote comes from an article on a satirical news website. Fact Check: The freshman congresswoman from New York is frequently credited with fake quotes, often in an attempt to make her look unintelligent. This image falls into that category, claiming that Ocasio-Cortez called for the repeal of Daylight Saving Time to mitigate climate change. (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Say Time Zones Will Protect The US From Chinese Missiles?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller found no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez has ever advocated for such action. The quote actually originated in an article published on a satirical news website called NPC Daily. According to the March 10 article, Ocasio-Cortez spent nearly four hours speaking on the House floor about the Green New Deal. The piece claims that it was during this speech that she called for ending the practice of moving clocks forward an hour.

Verdict: False Trump really did say the quote during a 2002 interview, but the image is an amalgamation of two pictures. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Epstein was arrested on charges of sex trafficking girls as young as 14 on Saturday. The financier has been accused of luring underaged girls to his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, to perform sex acts, according to the indictment. He previously faced similar charges in Florida in 2008 but took a plea deal that significantly reduced his sentence. Before the allegations came to light, Epstein had a rich and powerful circle of friends. His impressive rolodex included politicians and celebrities like Trump, former President Bill Clinton and actor Kevin Spacey. Epstein and Trump were friends at one point, and Trump even spoke favorably of him in a New York Magazine spotlight, but they have since had a falling out, according to Trump, and the president allegedly barred Epstein from his Mar-A-Lago estate. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told the magazine in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.” This quote is accurately quoted in the meme.  Trump and Epstein have been photographed together in the past. However, this image does not show one of those instances – it actually combines two separate pictures into one doctored image. The Daily Caller easily traced the image of Trump and a young Ivanka to Getty Images. The photograph captures their appearance at the opening of the Harley Davidson Cafe in New York City, according to the caption.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The photograph of Epstein also comes from Getty, appearing on the first page of results with the search term “Jeffrey Epstein.” He is attending a magazine launch in 2005 in the picture.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False Trump has never been denied a gaming license in Nevada and was actually granted one in 2004, according to the Nevada Gaming Commission. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Trump’s business group, the Trump Organization, currently owns 11 hotels bearing his name. Its hotel in Las Vegas opened in 2008. Although Las Vegas is home to quite a few hotels that double as casinos, the Trump International Hotel is not one of them. Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization, told The Wall Street Journal in 2016 that he was discussing plans to build a casino next to the hotel, but he said the plans were preliminary and that the Trump Organization was focused on developments elsewhere. He addressed the issue of a gaming license specifically in a 2013 interview with Las Vegas Inc. “We have no problem getting a gaming license, but we wanted to do something different here,” Trump said of the hotel. “We wanted a true luxury resort experience. It’s hard to have a high quality product when you walk into a ‘ding, ding, ding’ and there are people walking around in Hawaiian shirts with big plastic drink mugs.” Contrary to the claims of the Facebook post, The Daily Caller found no evidence that Trump was ever found not “trustworthy” enough for a gaming license in Las Vegas. “President Trump has, in fact, been found suitable to be involved in gaming in Nevada,” Nevada Gaming Commission Chairman Tony Alamo told the Caller via email. “He was never denied a license.”  The real estate mogul was granted a Nevada gaming license years before the Las Vegas hotel’s opening, as part of a separate business venture. “In 2004, President Trump filed an application and submitted to an investigation into his background in relation to his ownership interest in the Riviera Hotel & Casino,” Alamo explained. “Both the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission voted unanimously to approve Trump’s application for suitability as a shareholder (individually and by and through his companies), with just over 10% ownership interest, in the Riviera Holdings Corporation.  Later that same year he sold his interest in the Riviera.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Snopes identified an article from 1987 that may have spurred the claim. “Mr. Trump recently applied for a Nevada casino license, but Paul Bible, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission at the time, said that Nevada regulators would look askance at any ‘greenmailer’ who hurts casino companies in Nevada by acquiring large quantities of stock in order to sell the stake back to the company at a premium,” reads the article, published by The New York Times. The passage refers to accusations that Trump bought a stake in a rival casino operator to then sell it back at a profit, an accusation lawyers for Trump denied. The most recent addition to the Trump Hotels brand, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Vancouver, British Columbia, opened in February 2017.

Fact Check:  Millions of soccer fans tuned in Sunday to watch the U.S. women’s national team win its fourth World Cup final. The team beat the Netherlands 2-0 to secure the title, with Rapinoe scoring a goal in the 61st minute to break a scoring drought.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Rapinoe scored six goals during the whole tournament, earning her the award of top goal scorer. After scoring, she often makes her now-signature celebratory pose: arms proudly outstretched. This image depicts her post-goal pose, but with the addition of a large, blue “Trump 2020” flag in her left hand. Rapinoe has been outspoken in her political beliefs, from not joining her teammates in singing the national anthem to advocating for equal pay for female soccer players. In an interview posted on social media, she said she had no plans to go to the White House if the national team won.  “I’m not going to the fucking White House.” – @mPinoe pic.twitter.com/sz1ADG2WdT — Eight by Eight (@8by8mag) June 25, 2019   “I’m not going to the f*****g White House,” said Rapinoe in short interview clip with Eight by Eight, a soccer magazine. Rapinoe has made her opinion of President Donald Trump very clear, which makes the image of her holding a pro-Trump flag immediately suspect.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The Daily Caller found the original photograph, taken by the Associated Press on June 28. No flag in sight, it shows Rapinoe celebrating a U.S. goal during the quarterfinal match against France, according to the caption. Another Facebook user posted the doctored image with a more telling caption: “I just want this to go viral to tick her off!!” That post has been shared more than 200,000 times since it was originally posted on July 2.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsAislinn MurphyFact Check EditorFollow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

No sources from the philosopher’s era attribute these words to him. Fact Check: Socrates, born in Athens, Greece, around 470 B.C., is widely considered one of history’s most influential philosophers. He was a pioneer of the “Socratic method” of question-and-answer-based dialogue, still practiced to this day. Socrates’ students included Plato and Xenophon, who became historically significant figures in their own right. (RELATED: Did Aristotle Say, ‘We Are What We Repeatedly Do’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Controversial during his lifetime, Socrates was famously executed by the Athenian authorities for “impiety” and “corrupting the young.” This incident is discussed by Plato in his well-known dialogic work “Phaedo.” While Socrates often engaged in philosophical debates, he did not author the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. “I can affirm that no reliable source ever attributed this statement to Socrates,” University of Michigan historian and Socrates expert Sara Ahbel-Rappe told The Daily Caller in an email. “Socrates wrote nothing, so we rely entirely on reports about Socrates from contemporary witnesses, mostly Plato but also Xenophon.” The quote in question does not appear in the collected works of either Xenophon or Plato. Even if one of these philosophers had attributed the statement to Socrates, the accuracy of such an attribution would be far from certain. Scholars have long debated which ideas ascribed to Socrates by Plato, Xenophon and other contemporaries were truly expressed by him, an issue known as the “Socratic problem.”   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/AmericaFirstPatriotsforPresidentDonaldJTrump/photos/a.449113568489358/2328890367178326/?type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Socrates,https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/#SocStr,https://www.law.uchicago.edu/socratic-method,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Plato,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Xenophon,https://checkyourfact.com/2019/06/26/fact-check-aristotle-excellence-habit-repeatedly-do/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Socrates,https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/socrates-was-guilty-as-charged,http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedo.html,https://www.amazon.com/Companion-Socrates-Sara-Ahbel-Rappe/dp/1405192607,http://ancphil.lsa.umich.edu/people/faculty/ahbel-rappe/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Socrates,https://books.google.com/books?id=XfIERBH4_Z4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=complete+works+of+xenophon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi17vTJiqjjAhXBjFkKHcgiDBUQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=slander&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=eSKTvJDrr5kC&printsec=frontcover&dq=plato+collected+works&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1t6CDzKjjAhVF11kKHUIqBoMQ6wEIKzAA#v=snippet&q=slander&f=false,https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/supplement.html,https://www.iep.utm.edu/socrates/#SH1b,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e3979186958c91a387828a8f9a80828f8f8691cd808c8e","Did Socrates Say, ‘When The Debate Is Lost, Slander Becomes The Tool Of The Losers’?",,,,,

Fact Check:  While Einstein is best known for his contributions to the field of physics, most notably his theories of special and general relativity, he was also known to discuss philosophy, religion and politics and would occasionally mete out general life advice. “Try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value,” he once told a young man seeking guidance.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Einstein ever said or wrote the expression attributed to him on creativity. A search of the Einstein Archives Online returned no results for the word “contagious,” and a spokesperson for the Einstein Papers Project, another extensive collection of Einstein’s written work, told TheDCNF that she could not verify the quote. It also appears nowhere in the book “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein,” which features more than 1,000 verified Einstein quotes. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say That Technology Would Create A ‘Generation Of Idiots’?) According to the website Quote Investigator, the quote dates back to at least 1977, published in the book “Creative Growth Games.” The first known attribution to Einstein was in 1992, found in an advertisement for IBM. Einstein did value creativity and once said during an interview, “I am enough of the artist to draw freely upon my imagination. Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.”  Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  Hawthorne is one of the most celebrated American writers of the 19th century. A native of Salem, Massachusetts, he is best known for books like “The Scarlet Letter ” and “The House of the Seven Gables.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller News Foundation searched for the quote in Hawthorne’s collected works, but found no evidence that he ever wrote it. Brenda Wineapple, author of “Hawthorne: A Life,” confirmed that the quote was suspect. The website Quote Investigator traced the expression back to an 1848 newspaper article that used figurative language to define a series of terms such as love, wealth and happiness. “HAPPINESS. – A butterfly, which when pursued, seems always just beyond your grasp; but if you sit down quietly, may alight upon you,” reads the article. The entry was only signed with the letter “L.” The quote has also been widely attributed to the New England poet and philosopher Henry David Thoreau over the years, so much so that the Walden Woods Project includes it in its list of misquotations.  “This quotation, erroneously attributed to both Thoreau and Nathaniel Hawthorne, was written by the social worker, author and speaker, J. Richard Lessor,” reads the project’s website. “Although it doesn’t appear in any of Lessor’s books, it was published on motivational posters in the 1970s produced by Argus Communications.” While there is no evidence that Hawthorne ever coined the saying, it is thematically similar to a passage found in one of his notebooks that compares the pursuit of happiness to a “wild-goose chase.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally,” reads the passage. “Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness, without dreaming of it; but likely enough it is gone the moment we say to ourselves, ‘Here it is!’ like the chest of gold that treasure-seekers find.” Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Originally shared by actress Nancy Lee Grahn, the post suggests that the photos depict children detained by the Trump administration.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Trump administration is forcing children 2 sleep on cement floor with an aluminum blanket & lights on all night,” reads the tweet from Grahn. Verdict: False While these images do show crowded conditions at an Arizona holding facility, the pictures were taken in 2015, predating the Trump administration. Reports suggest that facilities continue to operate in comparably poor conditions. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The U.S. maintains and operates detention centers along the southern border that serve to temporarily hold migrants apprehended by Border Patrol. Amid reports of overcrowding and unsanitary conditions, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez referred to the centers as “concentration camps,” a comparison that was met with widespread criticism. Middle American Democrat shared a quote tweet the other week echoing Ocasio-Cortez’s remarks. “I swore I saw someone say it was wrong to compare these to concentration camps, but this is in fact what it is,” said one user responding to Grahn’s tweet. The post suggests that the Trump administration was responsible for the conditions shown in the tweet. However, the images were actually taken during the Obama administration. Originally presented as part of the court case Doe v. Nielsen, immigrant rights groups submitted a total of 15 still images taken from security cameras at detention centers. The two shared by Grahn were taken at a Tucson facility in August 2015.  “Individuals wrapped in Mylar sheets sleep on the concrete floor and benches; cell so crowded there is no room to move around,” reads one of the photo captions. While these conditions occurred under President Barack Obama’s watch, various reports have documented a similarly poor situation at some facilities run by the Trump administration. Sworn declarations, recently obtained from children and teenagers held at Texas facilities, describe detainees without adequate provisions being forced to sleep on the floor in Mylar blankets (often described as “aluminum” blankets).  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  A physician who visited a facility in McAllen, Texas, in June reported conditions including “extreme cold temperatures, lights on 24 hours a day, no adequate access to medical care, basic sanitation, water, or adequate food.” In an attempt to alleviate the conditions, Congress recently approved, and the president signed, a bill granting $4.6 billion in aid to help the federal government deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

Facebook/screenshot Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The Daily Caller found no evidence that Ginsburg suffered a stroke. The news alert came from a parody account on Twitter that has since been suspended. Fact Check: The tweet, which was screen grabbed and posted on Facebook, masquerades as a breaking news alert from Fox News Channel, saying, “JUST IN: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suffers massive stroke Wednesday evening, transported to ICU at DC hospital.” It encourages people to tune into the cable news network for more details. At first glance, the Twitter account appears authentic. It bears the Fox News name and logo, while also mimicking the breaking news format used by some outlets on Twitter.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, a closer inspection of the account reveals that it is not actually from Fox News. It has the wrong Twitter handle – @FoxChannel rather than @FoxNews – and lacks a blue check mark, which notes that the account has been verified by Twitter. The Caller confirmed with a Fox News spokesperson that the company did not tweet this out, and the account, which noted that it was satirical in its bio, has since been suspended by Twitter. The post’s claim that Ginsburg suffered a stroke Wednesday doesn’t hold up under scrutiny either. Ginsburg’s health made national headlines when she broke several ribs falling in her office on Nov. 7 and again when she had surgery to remove cancerous growths from her left lung a month later. If Ginsburg had a life-threatening medical issue, it would have been picked up by the media, yet no news outlets have reported on it, and the Supreme Court has not issued a press release.  Ginsburg appeared healthy during her July 2 appearance at Georgetown Law School, where she discussed gender equality and praised Justice Brett Kavanaugh for hiring an entirely female staff.

Fact Check: Reagan, who once promised to abolish the federal agency responsible for regulating firearms, left a complicated legacy on gun rights. He didn’t push for significant gun control laws during his presidency, but he did support two major pieces of legislation after leaving office: the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Brady Bill, which instituted background checks for firearms purchases, was named after Reagan’s press secretary James Brady, who was shot in the 1981 assassination attempt against Reagan. In 1994, he joined former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter in endorsing the 10-year ban on assault weapons. However, there is no evidence that Reagan, who was a member of the National Rifle Association, ever said this quote against gun control. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library keeps a collection of selected speeches from Reagan, going as far back as his tenure as governor of California, yet there is no record of him saying the quote in the library’s digital archive. “I never heard or read this from Reagan, and it certainly does not sound like him,” Dr. H.W. Brands, professor at the University of Texas at Austin and Reagan biographer, said in an email to The Daily Caller. “He was not one to advocate armed resistance to America’s own government.”  A quick Google search reveals the quote actually came from an 1850 speech written by Marx and Engels, who famously co-authored “The Communist Manifesto.” They included the quote in a speech delivered to the Communist League. “Under no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered,” reads the original quote. “Any attempt to disarm the workers must be frustrated, by force if necessary.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Follow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Bush. Fact Check: The National Postal Museum keeps a digital copy of every pre-paid stamp ever issued by the USPS in an online database that contains stamps dating back to 1847. A search of its online collection turned up no record of the Trump postage stamp.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, the Facebook video does closely resemble footage from the USPS’s dedication ceremony for a stamp honoring Bush on June 12. Officials unveiled the “forever” stamp at his presidential library and museum in College Station, Texas, with Bush family members and friends, former colleagues and the general public in attendance. Seven people stand around the stamp replica during the unveiling of the stamp, six of which are visible in the doctored video. They appear to be the exact same people in the exact same attire as those onstage for the removal of the curtain in footage of Bush’s stamp reveal. Even more dubious, the fake stamp design has Cyrillic lettering and “Russia 2017” next to Trump’s face. The president also appears to be wearing a Russian flag on his lapel in the portrait. The issuance of a postage stamp commemorating Bush came nearly seven months after the 41st president’s death on Nov. 30. The unveiling occurred on what would have been his 95th birthday.

Fact Check:  Darwin was a 19th century English scientist best known for his theory of evolution. In the 1859 book “On the Origins of Species,” he expounded upon the process of natural selection, whereby organisms are more likely to survive and reproduce if they are well adapted to their environment.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, nowhere in that book, or in any of Darwin’s writings, is the quote featured above to be found. A database of his collected works, Darwin Online, returned no matches, and the University of Cambridge’s Darwin Correspondence Project includes a version of the quote on its list of “six things Darwin never said.” The statement appears to have originated with a 1963 speech by a Louisiana State University professor named Leon C. Megginson, according to the website Quote Investigator. During that speech, Megginson states: “According to Darwin’s Origin of Species, it is not the most intellectual of the species that survives; it is not the strongest that survives; but the species that survives is the one that is able best to adapt and adjust to the changing environment in which it finds itself.” The quotation is Megginson’s attempt at summarizing, in a digestible way, the primary tenet of the theory of evolution, but is not a direct quote from Darwin or his book “On the Origins of Species.”  “This is a known mechanism for the generation of misattributions,” says Quote Investigator. “Person A summarizes, condenses, or restates the opinion of person B. At a later time the restatement is directly ascribed to person B.” Follow Brad on Twitter  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Have a fact check suggestion?

According to the caption, the photo was taken last year at a detention facility, presumably at the southern border. The post circulated again this past week after congressional Democrats toured two government facilities in Texas. The picture does not, however, depict a child held in one of these facilities. It actually shows a still from the 20th Century Fox movie “Deadpool 2,” starring Ryan Reynolds as the titular Marvel Comics character. Sixteen-year-old actor Julian Dennison, who appears in the viral image, plays a mutant teenager with pyrokinesis in the film. (RELATED: Did Greenpeace Hang A ‘CONCENTRATION CAMPS’ Banner From The Trump Hotel In Vegas?) In this frame, his character, “Firefist,” stares out from behind the glass of a high-tech prison for mutant criminals. A reverse image search also turns up similar stills from the movie. The Trump administration has come under fire recently for reports of poor conditions, including overcrowding and a lack of toiletries, at some of its holding facilities. President Donald Trump signed a bill Monday granting $4.6 billion in humanitarian aid to help the federal government deal with the influx of migrants at the southern border.

The event, called “We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration,” took place on the National Mall in Washington D.C. on Jan. 18 of that year, with a lineup of musicians that included Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder. Trump had a similar celebration in the days leading up to his inauguration in 2017. His inaugural concert featured musicians like country singer Toby Keith and pop rock band 3 Doors Down.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Follow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: The picture, shared this week by the page Super Elites for Trump, was discovered in The Chicago Tribune’s photography archive during the 2016 presidential election cycle. It does, in fact, show the Vermont senator, then a student at the University of Chicago, getting arrested.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Bernie identified it himself,” senior campaign advisor Tad Devine told the Tribune at the time. “He looked at it – he actually has his student ID from the University of Chicago in his wallet – and he said, ‘Yes, that indeed is (me).'” But the meme’s reason for his arrest – throwing eggs at black protestors – doesn’t hold up. Sanders became very involved in social activism during his time at UChicago. He helped organize a sit-in to protest segregated off-campus housing and served as a student leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization in the 1960s. It doesn’t make sense that he would throw eggs at black protestors, given his opposition to the racial discrimination of that era. Sanders got arrested during a civil rights demonstration in August 1963 – not 1964, as the image claims – for resisting arrest. He was found guilty, an old Tribune clipping reveals, and fined $25.  According to the clipping, 159 protestors were arrested during demonstrations that summer, held to protest the fact that portable classrooms were being used to accommodate students at overcrowded black schools. Protestors argued that the school district should have been sending some of those students to white schools with open seats.

It is actually a line by Scottish writer J.M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan. Fact Check: A novelist, playwright and poet, Wilde was an influential proponent of aestheticism, an intellectual movement that considered beauty to be the primary purpose of art. Among his best known works are the 1895 satirical play “The Importance of Being Earnest” and his 1891 philosophical novel “The Picture of Dorian Gray,” both considered literary classics. (RELATED: Did Mark Twain Pen This Quote On Kindness?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Wilde often brought up the subject of youth in his writings. “The old believe everything; the middle-aged suspect everything; the young know everything,” he wrote in 1894. However, he did not author the statement attributed to him in the Facebook post. The quote appears nowhere in his collected works. “This is said by a character called Earnest talking to another called Agatha, but not in a Wilde Play,” Donald Mead, chairman of The Oscar Wilde Society, told The Daily Caller in an email. “It is from Act 1 of the J.M. Barrie play ‘The Admirable Chrichton.'” Indeed, the statement appears in Barrie’s 1902 comedic play, published about two years after Wilde’s death. Barrie is best known as the creator of the fictional character Peter Pan.

Eric Swalwell claimed during Thursday night’s Democratic debate that he was the only candidate on stage “who has voted [for] and passed background checks” for firearms sales. Verdict: False   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  In 1993, former Vice President Joe Biden voted for the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which set federal requirements for background checks. Fact Check:  Ten candidates took to the debate stage Thursday for night two of the first Democratic presidential debate. Among them was Swalwell, who has distinguished himself from the large field of Democratic contenders by making gun control a flagship issue of his campaign. He has proposed a ban on all military-style semi-automatic weapons, along with a mandatory buy back program. Asked about his proposal during the debate, Swalwell touted his record on gun control. “I will approach this issue as a prosecutor. I will approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted [for] and passed background checks,” he said.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Swalwell has cosponsored a series of gun control bills in the House, including the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, which would require unlicensed sellers at gun shows, online and elsewhere to perform background checks. The bill passed the House in February, with Swalwell voting “yea,” but it has not received a vote in the Senate. By this measure, Swalwell was not the only candidate on stage to help get background check legislation passed in a chamber of Congress. In 1993, Biden, then a senator, voted in favor of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, the landmark bill that required background checks for firearms sold by licensed dealers. The bill became law days later. Following two high-casualty shootings in 2012, one at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, and the other at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, the legislature in John Hickenlooper’s state of Colorado took up a number of gun control bills, including one that would require background checks for private sales. Though Hickenlooper, who was among the 10 candidates on the debate stage Thursday, did not vote for the background check measure – he was serving as governor at the time of its passage – he did sign the measure into law in 2013. Other candidates on the debate stage have also signaled their support for expanded background checks, but have not had the chance to vote on such measures. In fact, every senator on the stage with Swalwell that night, including Bernie Sanders, Michael Bennet, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris, are cosponsors of S.42, the Background Check Expansion Act, the Senate companion to the bill Swalwell supported. The bill is unlikely to come up for a vote in a Republican-controlled Senate.  In an email, a spokesperson for Swalwell’s campaign made a different claim, telling The Daily Caller News Foundation that Swalwell “was the only candidate on stage who voted for and passed background checks that would cover every gun sale in America.” Swalwell’s verbiage was not nearly so specific. We rate his claim false.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Spanish was spoken a total of 14 times, it claims.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There were 63 mentions of President Donald Trump’s last name, 17 instances of the word “free” and nearly 80 of the word “America.” Spanish was spoken around eight times. Fact Check: Twenty candidates participated in the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2020 election cycle, hosted in Miami. To accommodate the crowded presidential field, the debate was split into two nights, with 10 candidates appearing on stage each night.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The first night’s lineup included Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar, as well as former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke and several lesser-known candidates. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, both frontrunners in the race, participated in night two of the debate. Millions of viewers watched the broadcasts, with many chiming in over social media. As commentary continued into the weekend, one image posted on Facebook claimed that Trump’s name was invoked an inordinate 1,326 times during the debate. Night one candidates largely avoided talking about Trump, as many outlets noted, but the second night’s debaters took a number of swipes at the president. In fact, Vox joked that “there were 10 new candidates onstage during night two of the first Democratic presidential debate – 11, if you count President Donald Trump.” However, the image greatly exaggerates the number of times his last name was uttered. According to transcripts from The New York Times, Trump was mentioned by name 63 times in the two nights of debate, including instances where the moderators said his name.  NBC News tallied 87 instances where Democrats referred to the president by name or title, with 35 mentions on the first night and 52 on the second night. CNN recorded a slightly different count. (RELATED: Did It Take 16 Minutes For 2020 Democrats To Mention Trump At The First Night of Debates?) The meme also touches on the number of times Democrats said the word “free,” likely referring to programs like tuition-free college and Medicare For All, the program championed by progressive candidates like Sanders.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “Every proposal that I have brought forward is fully paid for,” Sanders said during Thursday’s debate, though it took a direct question from NBC News anchor Savannah Guthrie for him to acknowledge that his health care proposal would require higher taxes for the middle class. A far cry from the 683 instances claimed in the meme, candidates and moderators used the word “free” 17 times across both debates, with three of those instances unrelated to such policy proposals. Booker mentioned the free market economy once, for example. As candidates fielded questions on topics ranging from climate change to immigration, they tried to convey their vision for the country. Unsurprisingly, the word “America” got tossed around quite a bit. The image claims it was used twice, but it actually appears in NYT transcripts nearly 80 times. The Daily Caller excluded the word “Americans” from this count, as well as a few instances where candidates referred to Central America. The meme was closer in its claim that Spanish was spoken 14 times during the debate. In lieu of transcribing these remarks, many news outlets used placeholder terms like “UNTRANSLATED” or “SPEAKING IN SPANISH” in their transcripts. Counting these instances alone, the Caller found eight instances of Spanish being spoken in transcripts from the Times. Candidates like O’Rourke, Booker and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro spoke Spanish, with varying degrees of proficiency, though our tally also includes the Spanish spoken by Telemundo host Jose Diaz-Balart.

All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Hemingway said this quote. The first known attribution to the novelist appeared years after his death. Fact Check: Hemingway was a Nobel Prize-winning author famous for works like “A Farewell to Arms” and “For Whom The Bell Tolls.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    His writings show that he did consider writing to be a challenge. “Writing is something that you can never do as well as it can be done,” he said in an August 1935 letter. “It is a perpetual challenge and it is more difficult than anything else that I have ever done  –  so I do it. And it makes me happy when I do it well.” However, there’s no reason to believe that Hemingway equated writing with bleeding, as the Facebook post claims. The quote appears nowhere in his collected works or selected letters. “This quote is one of the most persistent of the apocryphal Hemingway quotes, but no one has ever been able to pin down its origin,” Verna Kale, assistant research professor at Penn State University and associate editor of “The Letters of Ernest Hemingway,” told The Daily Caller in an email. The first known attribution to Hemingway occurred in 1973, more than a decade after his death, according to the website Quote Investigator.  The saying may have originated in print during the 1940s, when sportswriter Walter Wellesley “Red” Smith was asked whether he had difficulty writing a daily column. “Why, no,” he was quoted as saying in 1949. “You simply sit down at the typewriter, open your veins, and bleed.” American writer Paul Gallico penned a similar metaphor in 1946. “It is only when you open your veins and bleed onto the page a little that you establish contact with your reader,” he said in “Confessions of a Story Writer.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Follow David on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: “This photo was taken at the 1924 Democratic National Convention,” the caption reads. “It was known as the ‘Klanbake’ (just in case you want to Google it).”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The 1924 Democratic National Convention, which took 16 days and 103 ballots to select the presidential nominee, was held in New York City from June 24 to July 9 that year. It has been popularly described as a “Klanbake” for a couple of decades, according to research by journalist Jennifer Mendelsohn and academic Peter Shulman, who traced the origin of the term back to a contemporaneous report on the convention from the New York Daily News. According to JSTOR Daily, hundreds of KKK members attended as delegates. The image has been misidentified as Klansmen marching at the convention, but it was actually taken about five months later in Madison, Wisconsin, by Wisconsin State Journal photographer Arthur M. Vinje. It shows a parade of Klansmen en route to the funeral of a slain police officer in December of that year. “Ku Klux Klan (KKK) wearing conic masks and white robes parading down King Street to Schroeder Funeral Home for the funeral of Police officer Herbert Dreger,” reads the caption on the Wisconsin Historical Society’s website. “Dreger was shot to death in ‘Death’s Corner’ (South Murray Street) on December 2, 1924.” In the past few years, conservatives have deployed the image in an attempt to discredit Democrats. Conservative political commentator Dinesh D’Souza, for example, tweeted the image in 2017. Shulman subsequently corrected him, pointing to the historical society website.

It may be a paraphrase of a statement by Presbyterian minister John Witherspoon. Fact Check: Madison, who served as the country’s fourth president from 1809 to 1817, was one of the foremost framers of the Constitution.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    His writings give little indication as to his views on religious doctrine, leading to scholarly debate about his religious convictions. According to some historians, Madison was a Deist, rather than a conventional Christian as the misattributed quote would suggest. Though he persistently advocated for religious freedom, Madison did not author the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The statement appears nowhere in his collected works. “It certainly doesn’t sound like anything Madison would say, and indeed sounds like something he would staunchly disavow,” Terence Ball, professor emeritus and Madison expert at Arizona State University, told The Daily Caller. The quote may be a paraphrase of a similar statement: “Accursed be all that learning which sets itself in opposition to the cross of Christ!” This statement was made in a sermon by Witherspoon, the one-time president of the College of New Jersey, which would later become Princeton University. Madison himself attended the college from 1769 to 1771, studying under Witherspoon. A handful of years later, Witherspoon became the only clergyman to sign of the Declaration of Independence.  The quote has also been attributed to Jonathan Dickinson, the College of New Jersey’s first president. However, we couldn’t locate any source contemporary to Dickinson crediting him with the quote. Historian Bryan Lebeau told the Caller that he could find no record of Dickinson making this statement.

Fact Check: Poe was a 19th century American writer credited with inventing the detective genre. Famous for his poems and short stories, works like “The Tell-Tale Heart” and “The Fall of the House of Usher” continue to be widely read to this day.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Poe did love cats and occasionally wrote about them. In one essay, titled “Instinct vs. Reason – a Black Cat,” he wrote, “The writer of this article is the owner of one of the most remarkable black cats in the world – and this saying much; for it will be remembered that black cats are all of them witches.” However, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that the quote attributed to Poe on Facebook is genuine. A search of his complete works, listed on the Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore website, turned up no matches. A series of experts also dismissed the quote as misattributed. “I have electronic versions of pretty much everything that has been attributed to Poe, including some things which have been attributed to him erroneously, and find no record of such a phrase. I find no hits even if I correct the ungrammatical ‘mysterious’ to ‘mysteriously,'” said Jeffrey A. Savoye, the secretary and treasurer of the Poe Society, in an email to TheDCNF.  “Just reading the sentence, it does not really sound like Poe to me anyway,” he added. The structure of the sentence also raised red flags for Amy Branam Armiento, an associate professor of English at Frostburg State University and president of the Poe Studies Association. “It’s not Poe. My first clue was that it was ungrammatical,” she said in an email.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  When asked about the authenticity of the quote, Poe expert J.

Lewis wrote in his book “Mere Christianity” that “humility isn’t thinking less of yourself – it’s thinking of yourself less.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Lewis did not author this statement, which appears to only date back to the 1990s. Fact Check: A writer and academic at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge, Lewis was a convert to Christianity and an influential apologist for the religion. His writings are still widely read today, decades after his death. Lewis is perhaps best known for his novel series “The Chronicles of Narnia,” considered a classic of the fantasy genre.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though Lewis does discuss humility in his 1952 work “Mere Christianity,” the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post does not appear in that book, nor in any of his other writings. “I’ve examined this quote and with absolute certainty report that Lewis did not write it,” William O’Flaherty, author of “The Misquotable C.S. Lewis,” told The Daily Caller in an email. The C.S. Lewis Foundation includes the statement in its list of quotes misattributed to Lewis. The quote does appear in Christian pastor Rick Warren‘s popular book “The Purpose Driven Life,” published in 2002. While he quotes Lewis several times in that book, Warren does not attribute this particular statement to him. A similar statement can also be found in the 1998 book “This Was Your Life! Preparing to Meet God Face to Face.” The authors quote Lewis the very next sentence, which may have led some people to misattribute the quote.  The origin of the quote may actually date back some years earlier. According to etymologist Barry Popick, a variation appeared in a March 1990 edition of The Democrat and Chronicle, where American author Ken Blanchard is quoted as saying, “Don’t think less of yourself, just think of yourself less.” Follow Trevor on Twitter  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Have a fact check suggestion? Send ideas to [email protected].  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1273300259486035&set=a.110906679058738&type=3&theater,https://www.britannica.com/biography/C-S-Lewis,http://www.cslewis.com/us/about-cs-lewis/,http://www.cslewis.com/c-s-lewis-as-atheist-turned-apostle/,https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/musiciansartistsandwriters/cs-lewis.html,http://www.cslewis.com/c-s-lewiss-eternal-legacy/,https://www.amazon.com/Chronicles-Narnia-C-S-Lewis/dp/0066238501,https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Chronicles-of-Narnia,https://books.google.com/books?id=p1Pbhy6SugwC&pg=PA187&dq=mere+christianity&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSzpHoiIrjAhUFjVkKHSQaCCAQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=humble&f=false,https://www.amazon.com/Mere-Christianity-C-S-Lewis/dp/0060652926,https://www.amazon.com/Misquotable-C-S-Lewis-Actually-Matters/dp/1532638426,http://www.cslewis.org/,http://www.cslewis.org/aboutus/faq/quotes-misattributed/,https://books.google.com/books?id=ggWoFZSDlkcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+purpose+driven+life&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwii8Ojxi4rjAhWh2FkKHXSiBTQQ6AEIKjAA#v=snippet&q=humility&f=false,https://pastorrick.com/,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/28/books/review/faithbased-publishing.html,https://www.amazon.com/Purpose-Driven-Life-What-Earth/dp/031033750X,https://books.google.com/books?id=ggWoFZSDlkcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+purpose+driven+life&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwii8Ojxi4rjAhWh2FkKHXSiBTQQ6AEIKjAA#v=snippet&q=lewis&f=false,https://books.google.com/books?id=fXlzECSUeIMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=This+Was+Your+LIfe!+Preparing+to+Meet+God+Face+to+Face+by+Rich+Howard+and+Jamie+Lash&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjA9JKUi43jAhVTaM0KHQOnD3QQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=think&f=false,https://www.amazon.com/This-Was-Your-Life-Preparing/dp/0800792599,https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/humility_is_not_thinking_less,https://www.kenblanchard.com/About-Us/Meet-the-Team/Ken-Blanchard,https://twitter.com/tschakohl711,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f7838592819885b793969e9b8e94969b9b9285d994989a,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01757364776e73416560686d7862606d6d64732f626e6c","Did CS Lewis Say, ‘Humility Isn’t Thinking Less Of Yourself – It’s Thinking Of Yourself Less’?",,,,,

Verdict: False The image, taken in June 2016, shows an attendee of a gay pride parade in Athens, Greece, not O’Rourke. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image circulated early Thursday morning after O’Rourke, the former representative of Texas’s 16th congressional district, participated in night one of the first Democratic presidential debate. “Anyone watch the debates tonight?” the post asks. It previously made the rounds on social media back in February when his candidacy was still tentative. The picture allegedly shows O’Rourke nearly naked with words painted onto his body, such as “feminist,” “non-binary” and “naturist.” Though this person may bear a passing resemblance to O’Rourke, the photo does not show the presidential hopeful. It actually shows a participant in a gay pride parade that happened in Athens, Greece, several years ago. Photographer Giorgos Georgiou captured a similar image, dated June 11, 2016, at that parade.  As it turns out, O’Rourke spoke at the El Paso High School commencement ceremony on the same date, FactCheck.org discovered, so it is impossible that he was in Greece at the time of the parade.

For this very reason peoples of other faiths have been afforded asylum, prosperity, and freedom of worship here.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence that Henry authored this statement. It actually comes from a 1956 article mentioning his Christian faith, published in “The Virginian” magazine. Fact Check: Henry is most famous for his influential 1775 speech in which he urged Virginians to prepare for war with Great Britain, allegedly declaring, “Give me liberty or give me death!” He served five terms as governor of Virginia, from 1776 to 1779 and again from 1784 to 1786.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Contrary to the claims of the Facebook post, Henry was not a ratifier of the U.S. Constitution. He refused to attend the 1787 Constitutional Convention and strongly opposed the document’s ratification, believing that it insufficiently protected individual and states’ rights. (RELATED: Did Patrick Henry Say The Constitution ‘Is An Instrument For The People To Restrain The Government’?) In addition, Henry did not author the statement attributed to him in the post. “This is a perplexing case because Henry certainly was a devout Christian, but the quotation itself is of relatively recent origin,” Baylor University historian and Henry expert Thomas Kidd wrote in a 2012 article for HuffPost. The statement actually comes from an article mentioning Henry’s Christian faith, published in the April 1956 issue of “The Virginian” magazine. The Library of Virginia provided The Daily Caller with a copy of this article. An excerpt noting the Christian faith of Patrick Henry in “The Virginian” magazine, April 1956. Courtesy of the Library of Virginia. The article quotes Henry’s will, which in one part states, “This is all the Inheritance I can give to my dear family, The religion of Christ can give them one which will make them rich indeed.”  Henry died in 1799 at his home, Virginia’s Red Hill plantation.

Jean Carroll?3:41 PM 06/28/2019Brad Sylvester | Fact Check Reporter share on facebook tweet this show commentsThe Facebook page Teanderthal Party shared an image that purportedly shows an old photograph of Donald Trump with E. Jean Carroll, the advice columnist who recently accused the president of sexual assault.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The woman in the picture is makeup artist Jill Harth, not Carroll. Fact Check: Carroll made headlines last week after New York Magazine published an excerpt from her upcoming book, “What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal.” In it, she alleges that Trump sexually assaulted her in the dressing room of a luxury department store in the 1990s.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The White House has denied the allegation, calling the story “completely false and unrealistic.” Trump, for his part, claimed that he has never met Carroll. Even though Teanderthal Party could have simply pointed to a black and white photo of Trump and Carroll speaking to one another at a party, circa 1987, the page instead tries to refute Trump’s claim by showing a photo of Trump and a blonde woman, ostensibly Carroll. There’s just one problem: it’s not Carroll in the picture. Trump is actually pictured with Harth, a woman he dated briefly in the 1990s. The photo is shown in a 2016 episode of “Inside Edition” that profiled Harth, who has also accused Trump of sexual misconduct. In an email to The Daily Caller News Foundation, Harth confirmed that she, not Carroll, appears in the photo. An agent for Carroll also confirmed that it wasn’t her pictured.  In an interview with The New York Times, Carroll disputed the characterization that she was raped, saying, “My word is fight, my word is not the victim one. I have not been raped. Something has not been done to me. I fought.” Follow Brad on Twitter  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    As one of the simplest ways to signal patriotism, the American flag lapel pin has become a staple for both elected and aspiring politicians. During former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, he got flack for often not wearing one during his public appearances. This line of criticism appeared on social media Thursday, with the image alleging that none of the candidates wore an American flag pin during night one of the first Democratic primary debate. That was not the case, however, since four out of the 10 candidates wore them onstage. (RELATED: Was Trump The Only World Leader To Not Wear A G20 Lapel Pin?) Ten candidates from a 24-candidate field took the stage Wednesday for the first of two nights of debate hosted by NBC. Notable contenders included Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. The four Democrats who wore flag pins on their lapels were New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.

It may be a version of a statement written by American author H.L. Mencken. Fact Check: François-Marie Arouet, better known by his pen name “Voltaire,” was one of the most influential figures of the Enlightenment, an intellectual movement that championed human reason. A poet, satirist and philosopher, Voltaire is perhaps best known for his 1759 novella “Candide.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though Voltaire was a critic of organized religion, he did not author the quote attributed to him in the Facebook post. The statement appears nowhere in his collected works. “This quote is very widely attributed to Voltaire, and is certainly in his style, but in fact it is from H.L. Mencken, who has a certain similarity to Voltaire in his expression,” City University of New York theatre historian Marvin Carlson, an expert on Voltaire’s theatrical works, told The Daily Caller in an email. Indeed, the quote appears to be a version of a statement by Mencken, who wrote in his 1916 work “A Book of Burlesques,” “Creator. A comedian whose audience is afraid to laugh.” An influential literary figure in his own right, Mencken was sometimes referred to as “the Voltaire of his time.”  Follow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion? Send ideas to [email protected].  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });   share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2441097049452404&set=a.1759064624322320&type=3&theater,https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/voltaire/,https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19942/19942-h/19942-h.htm,https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-should-know-about-voltaire,https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/voltaire-the-works-of-voltaire-a-contemporary-version-in-21-vols,https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Theatre/Faculty-Bios/Marvin-Carlson,https://www.amazon.com/Voltaire-Theatre-Eighteenth-Century-Contributions/dp/0313303029,https://www.britannica.com/biography/H-L-Mencken,https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22145/22145-h/22145-h.htm,http://www.menckenhouse.org/txt/about/about_hlm.htm,https://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/mencken/bio.html,http://baltimoreauthors.ubalt.edu/writers/henrymencken.htm,https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/02/books/flap-and-doodle-balder-and-dash.html,https://twitter.com/tschakohl711,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1f6b6d7a69706d5f7b7e7673667c7e73737a6d317c7072,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0d797f687b627f4d696c6461746e6c6161687f236e6260","Did Voltaire Say, ‘God Is A Comedian Playing To An Audience Too Afraid To Laugh’?",,,,,

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez likened detention centers holding illegal immigrants at the southern border to concentration camps in an Instagram Live video last week. Shortly thereafter, reports emerged detailing the poor conditions witnessed at some of these facilities. The image, which depicts a Greenpeace banner hanging from the Last Vegas hotel in protest, is actually a screenshot of a video originally posted on Twitter. The video creator, Paul Lee Ticks, has a history of posting doctored images and videos on social media. In fact, he previously posted a video very similar to the one in question, only with a different message on the photoshopped banner. Greenpeace, an environmental nonprofit, often uses yellow banners to make political statements. Its members have even deployed prominent banners to protest the Trump administration in the past. However, Greenpeace confirmed that it took no such action in Las Vegas. Perry Wheeler, senior communications specialist for Greenpeace, told the Caller in an email, “It is indeed a fake video.”  It also tweeted out a statement, declaring the video a hoax.  While this video is fake, the Trump administration’s inhumane detention centers are, tragically, very real.

Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  While there were long stretches where Trump was not mentioned by name, the first reference to the president occurred about two minutes after moderators asked the first question. Fact Check: Millions of viewers tuned in Wednesday to watch night one of the first 2020 Democratic debate, hosted in downtown Miami. Split into two nights to accommodate the 20 candidates who qualified for the debate stage, the first 10 candidates fielded questions on topics ranging from climate change to health care. PBS covered the event, at one point sharing this surprising stat on Facebook: “It was 16 minutes into the debate before President Donald Trump’s name was uttered.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });     The post links to a PBS article titled “Trump mentions are scarce in Democratic presidential debate,” which includes the same stat. Other outlets offered similar analysis: The Hill said the president was “almost entirely unmentioned” during the debate, while The Atlantic jested that “the Resistance was dozing off on a couch.” But PBS’s specific claim – that 16 minutes passed before someone mentioned Trump by name – doesn’t hold up. From the time moderators Savannah Guthrie and Lester Holt welcomed viewers to the Democratic debate to when Trump’s name was first invoked, a little more than 4 minutes elapsed. Skipping over some introductory remarks from the moderators, as well as the on-air graphics that kicked off the program, about two minutes passed.  It was Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the second candidate to speak that night, who first mentioned Trump. “Well, first, the economy. We know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity,” she said. “And Donald Trump just sits in the White House and gloats about what’s going on, when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Klobuchar mentioned Trump nine times during the debate, the most of any candidate, according to an analysis by NBC News. In total, NBC recorded 35 instances where Trump came up. (CNN tallied slightly different numbers.) A transcript from that night, published by The Washington Post, returned more than a dozen instances of candidates mentioning Trump by name. At other points, rather than uttering his name, candidates either alluded to or referred to Trump as the president. “Let’s recognize the situation we’re in, that the American people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful. That’s not what we have right now,” argued Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. The Associated Press also claimed that 16 minutes elapsed before the first mention of Trump, although the AP promptly corrected its reporting. “This item has been corrected to show that Klobuchar uttered Trump’s name a few minutes into the debate, not 16 minutes into the debate,” reads a correction from the wire service.

Excellence then, is not an act, but a habit.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False  While the sentiment is representative of what Aristotle thought, there is no evidence he ever made this statement. The quote appears to have originated with the 1926 book “The Story of Philosophy.” Fact Check:  Aristotle, who was active during the 4th century B.C., is regarded as one of the most influential philosophers to have ever lived. A search of his writings reveals that in one of his many works, Aristotle did make a remark about achieving “moral excellence” (translated as “virtue” in some editions) through good habits.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In Book II of “Nicomachean Ethics,” he states: “Excellence, then, being of these two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual excellence owes its birth and growth mainly to instruction, and so requires time and experience, while moral excellence is the result of habit or custom.” There is no reason to believe, however, that Aristotle wrote the particular saying attributed to him in the Facebook post. “This is a well-known misattribution. It’s Aristotelian in spirit but not in the letter,” said Jonathan Buttaci, assistant professor of philosophy at the Catholic University of America, in an email to The Daily Caller News Foundation. The quote appears to have originated with the 1926 book “The Story of Philosophy” in which author Will Durant chronicles the work of history’s greatest philosophers, including Aristotle. The phrase is Durant’s attempt at capturing, in his own words, a certain Aristotelian sentiment, but is not a direct quotation from Aristotle.  “Those aren’t Aristotle’s words translated into English. But it is an accurate and succinct way of conveying what Aristotle says in a more complicated way,” Richard Kraut, a professor of philosophy at Northwestern University, told TheDCNF in an email.

It is a doctored version of a paparazzi photo taken in 2009. Fact Check:  The image started cropping up on social media in April, around the same time that former Vice President Joe Biden launched his 2020 presidential campaign. It pokes fun at Biden’s ongoing public image issue over his respect for women’s personal space, which has prompted President Donald Trump to nickname him “SleepyCreepy Joe.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Though the lewd campaign shirt does actually exist, Aniston never wore it. A quick Google image search revealed that the “Biden 2020” logo and hands were superimposed onto a paparazzi photograph. Per the image caption, the photo was taken in 2009 when she was filming an action comedy film called “The Bounty Hunter” in New York City. Aniston has supported Democratic political candidates in the past, which makes a picture of her poking fun at Biden more dubious. According to Federal Election Commission documents, Aniston donated $36,100 to Hillary Clinton and $30,700 to the Democratic National Committee in 2016. She has also given money to the Obama Victory Fund. The “Friends” actress is not the only celebrity whose attire has been photoshopped to further a political message on social media. Chris Evans, star of the “Avengers” franchise, appeared recently in a doctored image on Facebook wearing a t-shirt critical of Republicans.

Fact Check: Einstein famously developed the theory of special relativity, which suggests that objects can approach but not exceed the speed of light. His theory of general relativity, put forward in 1915, dealt with gravity and the distortion of space-time.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Throughout his career, Einstein published many scientific papers and multiple books. However, The Daily Caller could not find the quote anywhere in his collected works. (RELATED: Did Einstein Say That Technology Would Create A ‘Generation Of Idiots’?) It does appear in “The Ultimate Quotable Einstein,” a compilation of Einstein quotes published by Princeton University Press, where it falls under the “misattributed” section. The book cites Rita Mae Brown’s 1983 book “Sudden Death” as the source of the quote. Brown credits one of the book’s characters with saying the well-known phrase. This quote may have actually originated with a Narcotics Anonymous pamphlet two years earlier, according to the website Quote Investigator. Printed in 1981, the pamphlet offers a slightly different version of the saying: “Insanity is repeating the same mistakes and expecting different results.” Follow Aislinn on Twitter  Have a fact check suggestion?

It was said, however, by the fictional Adams in the 1969 musical “1776.” Fact Check:  The internet is littered with quotes misattributed to famous figures, the founding fathers in particular. (RELATED: Did Benjamin Franklin Say, ‘Democracy Is Two Wolves And A Lamb Voting On What To Have For Lunch’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The saying attributed to Adams is one such misquotation. The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that he ever said or wrote these words. A search of the digital edition of The Adams Papers returned no matches. Sara Martin, editor-in-chief of the Papers, told TheDCNF in an email that the quote comes from the 1969 Broadway musical “1776,” uttered by a character playing Adams during a monologue: I have come to the conclusion that one useless man is called a disgrace; that two are called a law firm; and that three or more become a Congress! And, by God, I have had this Congress! For 10 years, King George and his Parliament have gulled, cullied and diddled these Colonies with their illegal taxes! Stamp Acts, Townshend Acts, Sugar Acts, Tea Acts! And when we dared stand up like men, they have stopped our trade, seized our ships, blockaded our ports, burned our towns and spilled our blood! And still this Congress refuses to grant any of my proposals on independence, even so much as the courtesy of open debate! Good God, what in Hell are you waiting for? While this character is based on the historical figure of Adams, the lines were nonetheless imagined by the musical’s writers. Two other historians who have studied Adams told TheDCNF that they did not recognize the phrase as a genuine Adams quote.  Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Do not let the world make you hard. Do not let pain make you hate. Do not let the bitterness steal your sweetness.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “Take pride that even though the rest of the world may disagree, you still believe it to be a beautiful place,” the quote continues. Verdict: False This passage was actually written by Iain Thomas in 2007 and later published in his poetry collection “I Wrote This For You.” Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Vonnegut was an American author best known for his satirical writing style. He wrote several novels that are considered classics, including “Slaughterhouse-Five” and “Cat’s Cradle.” Vonnegut’s status as a literary icon has prompted those on social media to share a myriad of quotes attributed to the author, though not always accurately. In this case, the alleged quote is actually a poem called “The Fur,” written by Thomas. He originally published the poem anonymously on his blog in 2007, but later included it in the poetry collection “I Wrote This For You” under his real name. The quote has since been falsely attributed to Vonnegut, despite Thomas’ attempts to set the record straight. “At some point, somewhere on the internet, someone who I have no doubt really liked the quote, decided that it needed to have been said by someone more important and with a touch more gravitas than some, still living, semi-anonymous blogger somewhere,” Thomas wrote in a 2016 article for HuffPost. “So they picked Kurt Vonnegut.”  “I’m sorry for Thomas, particularly because he’s gone to such lengths to correct the record,” Thomas Hertweck, co-vice president of the Kurt Vonnegut Society and lecturer at the University of Massachusetts- Dartmouth, told The Daily Caller in an email. “This sort of thing happens all the time, especially since Vonnegut died.” Besides Hertweck, Julia Whitehead, founder and CEO of the Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library, and the museum’s curator, Chris Lafave, also confirmed that Vonnegut did not pen this quote.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “This quote has been misattributed to Vonnegut for some time, and while there is currently no permanent archive of everything Kurt ever said, it has never appeared in anything published or archived,” Lafave told the Caller in an email.

Fact Check: This quote may have originated with “P.S. I Love You,” a book of sayings compiled by author H. Jackson Brown Jr. Published in 1990, the full expression encourages readers to “throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Although Brown credited his mother with the saying, it was only a matter of years before others erroneously attributed the quote to Twain, author of American classics like “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” and “Life on the Mississippi.” The Daily Caller reached out to several experts, none of whom thought the quote was authentic. It appears nowhere in his collected works. “Though he’s not the source of this aphorism, Twain did frequently endorse the benefit of taking risks and trying new things, particularly exploring unfamiliar places and cultures,” Matthew Seybold, assistant professor of American literature at Elmira College and editor-in-chief of MarkTwainStudies.org, told The Daily Caller in an email. Seybold pointed to Twain’s 1869 work “The Innocents Abroad” as one example.  “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts,” Twain wrote. “Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things can not be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one’s lifetime.” Follow David on Twitter  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check:  Roosevelt served as first lady from 1933 to 1945, during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s four terms in office. She is widely credited with transforming the role of first lady from one in which the president’s spouse mainly acts as a “gracious hostess” to one in which she champions social causes more actively.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Throughout her life, Roosevelt delivered speeches and published articles on numerous topics, including female empowerment. However, the quote attributed to her in the image does not appear in any of her writings. It actually originated with a scholarly article written by Ulrich in 1976, appearing in the opening paragraph. She penned the saying “well-behaved women seldom make history” in writing about the Puritan women celebrated in funeral sermons. Though figures like Roosevelt or Marilyn Monroe often have the saying misattributed to them, Ulrich confirmed that she is the source of the quote. “I actually wrote a book explaining the origin of the quotation and then exploring some of the many ways women make history,” she told The Daily Caller in an email.  According to Ulrich’s book “Well-Behaved Women Seldom Make History,” journalist Kay Mills introduced the quote to popular culture in 1995 when she used a slightly altered version as the epigraph for her own women’s history book. Mills changed the word “seldom” to “rarely.” The altered version of the quote has since appeared on t-shirts and bumper sticks, as well as other retail products. Feminist groups utilize the phrase, too.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Follow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

The misattribution likely stems from Carnegie quoting Franklin in close proximity to the saying. Fact Check: This Facebook post attempts to use the quote, featured along with a photoshopped image of Franklin wearing a “Make Our Government Great Again” hat, to promote unity in American politics.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The purported saying is just one of the many quotes attributed to Franklin, inventor of the lightning rod and one of the nation’s best known founders. However, a quick Google search shows this quote actually belongs to Carnegie, the American author who wrote “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” (RELATED: Did Benjamin Franklin Say, ‘We Are All Born Ignorant, But One Must Work Hard To Remain Stupid’?) Since its original publication in 1936, the self-help book has been sold to millions of readers worldwide. It’s also the source for the misattributed quote. The book holds up successful men as role models and quotes Franklin just a line above the phrase in question. “The secret of his success? ‘I will speak ill of no man,’ he said, ‘… and speak all the good I know of everybody,'” wrote Carnegie. “Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain – and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.” The misattribution likely comes from the close proximity of these lines. “This ‘don’t criticize, condemn, or complain’ trio is the starting point for many Carnegie seminars to this day,” Blaine McCormick, a professor at Baylor University and author of “Ben Franklin: America’s Original Entrepreneur,” told The Daily Caller in an email.

Fact Check: As leader of the British people during World War II, Churchill embodied the ethos of determination and grit. “You’ll never find a Churchill quote online that says, ‘I give up easily,’ because he was the opposite,” Lee Pollock, interim executive director at the International Churchill Society, told The Daily Caller. While a positive mindset was Churchill’s “stock and trade,” there is no evidence he ever called attitude a “little thing that makes a big difference.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “It is a nice ‘Churchill-sounding’ phrase but not something he specifically said,” Pollock said. (RELATED: Did Winston Churchill Say, ‘A Lie Gets Halfway Around The World Before The Truth Has A Chance To Get Its Pants On’?) Tim Riley, chief curator at the National Churchill Museum, agreed: the quote can’t be attributed to the statesman, but it does have a churchillian ring to it. Riley pointed to a 1954 speech Churchill gave at Guildhall in London. “For myself I am an optimist – it does not seem to be much use being anything else,” he told the audience. The saying has been attributed to Churchill since at least 2003, according to the website Quote Investigator. Follow David on Twitter  Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False While black people were lynched during the summer of 1919, this image actually shows a black man being pulled off a street car during a 1943 race riot in Detroit. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The post shared on Facebook claims to show an incident that took place during the “Red Summer” of 1919, when lynchings and race riots against blacks occurred across the U.S. The term “Red Summer” was coined by civil rights activist James Weldon Johnson, connoting the significant bloodshed of that summer’s violence. The image, however, has been miscaptioned. The Daily Caller traced the photo back to The Associated Press website, and according to the image caption, it actually shows a black man being dragged from a street car during a June 1943 race riot in Detroit. On top of $2 million in damages, the riot reportedly left 34 dead and 700 injured, according to the Detroit Historical Society. The picture also appears in a collection of newspaper clippings related to the 1943 riot, housed at the University of Michigan’s Bentley Historical Library. “Woodward crowd pictured after it had stopped a street car and was in the act of dragging a Negro passenger into the street,” reads the photo caption, referencing Woodward Avenue, a historic roadway in Detroit.  According to the library, it was published in the June 22, 1943 issue of The Detroit Free Press, featured in a collage of pictures from that riot. Though black people were lynched or attacked after World War I, as the Facebook post notes, there is nothing to suggest the man being pulled from the street car in the photo was himself a uniformed service member or lynched.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “I do not recall any reference of a lynching during the 1943 riot,” Dominic Capeci, a historian at Missouri State University and co-author of “Layered Violence: The Detroit Rioters of 1943,” told the Caller in an email. Multiple websites have erroneously claimed that the image shows an incident that occurred during the “Red Summer” of 1919. The site Old Magazine Articles previously displayed the image on a page about the 1919 riots, but the site’s editor acknowledged the error and took the image down after being contacted by the Caller.

Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Washington ever making this statement. Fact Check: This quote has appeared in print for more than a century, with etymologist Barry Popik tracing its first known appearance to 1902, attributed to none other than the country’s first president, who died in 1799.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The original version of the quote is longer, offering this warning about government: “Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.” The expression has been investigated by a number of researchers, none of whom could locate it anywhere in Washington’s writings. His estate at Mount Vernon includes the quote in its list of “spurious quotations.” According to the website Quote Investigator, the depiction of government as “a dangerous servant and a fearful master” is reminiscent of a centuries-old saying about water and fire. “Water is a very good seruaunt, but it is a cruell mayster,” reads an excerpt from 1562. (Notice that the quote ascribed to Washington alters the sentiment here: it calls the servant “dangerous” rather than “good.”)  The phrase “government is force” dates back to at least 1890, according to Popik. “The purification of politics is an iridescent dream,” Kansas Senator John James Ingalls was quoted as saying. “Government is force. Politics is a battle for supremacy.” Follow David on Twitter  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Sanders has served as press secretary since July 2017, when she replaced Sean Spicer after his resignation from the post. On June 13, President Donald Trump announced via Twitter that Sanders would be leaving the White House at the end of the month, thanking her “for a job well done!”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });     ….She is a very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job! I hope she decides to run for Governor of Arkansas – she would be fantastic. Sarah, thank you for a job well done! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2019  The claim that Sanders described her job search as a struggle is unsupported. No such statement appears in any news reports online. A similar claim circulated in December 2018, when an anonymous source told Yahoo News that Sanders, despite trying to leave the White House, could not find a new job. “Everybody’s told her no,” claimed the source, described only as a former transition team member. “Sarah can’t find work.” A second anonymous source, a former White House official, told the publication the same thing.  When Yahoo News asked Sanders about the rumor that she was looking to leave the White House, she responded by saying that she was “traveling,” providing no further comment. Although neither anonymous source claimed that Sanders herself said she was “struggling” to find new work, the Facebook page Occupy Democrats made that very claim the day after the story first appeared.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Within hours of publication, Yahoo News updated its story, omitting any reference to Sanders “struggling” to find work. The publication also removed the claim, offered by the same anonymous transition team member, that then-principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah no longer had an office or a phone at the White House. “The story should have noted that he retains an office in the Executive Office Building and a government cellphone,” reads an editors note.

Screenshot/Facebook “No, this is not Live Aid,” the image reads. “This is a Trump rally in downtown Philly yesterday. Why isn’t the media showing this???”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False This is a photoshopped image of a 1985 Live Aid benefit concert in London.  Fact Check: This image attempts to depict large turnout for a supposed rally held by Trump, who officially kicked off his 2020 presidential election campaign Tuesday. Posted on May 27, the meme suggests the rally had occurred the day before.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The president did hold a rally in Pennsylvania that month, but it took place on May 20 in Montoursville, coming two days after Democratic candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden made his own stop in Philadelphia. Trump’s visit was meant to bolster support for Republican congressional candidate Fred Keller ahead of a special election. However, this image does not show that rally.  The actual picture, found on a Queen fan page, captures the band’s performance at a 1985 Live Aid benefit concert, according to the photo caption. The event raised relief money for a then-ongoing Ethiopian famine, with more than 72,000 people in attendance at Wembley Stadium on July 13, 1985. The photoshopped image covers up the Live Aid branding on either side of the stage with “Trump 2020” logos and hides the tent featured in the original image with a Trump banner. Furthermore, signage above the stage in the photoshopped image gives away the true nature of the photo. “Feed the World. July 13th 1985 at Wembley Stadium,” it reads. The image also closely resembles a picture taken by photographer Brendan Monks at the event.  Follow Aislinn on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: This meme uses the quote to insult Donald Trump’s intelligence, pairing it with a photo of the president and a caption that reads, “The hardest working man in America.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The alleged quote has been attributed to Franklin, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and one of the nation’s most prominent founders, countless times online. However, there is no evidence that he ever made this statement. A search of Franklin’s collected works turned up nothing similar. “I’ve never run across it. Doesn’t sound like Franklin to me,” H.W. Brands, historian and author of “The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin,” told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an email. (RELATED: Did Benjamin Franklin Say This Quote About Avoiding Tyranny?) In its current form, the expression has only been circulating in print since 1999, according to etymologist Barry Popik. Variations of the quote, however, date back much further. The saying resembles the words of 18th century French philosopher Claude Adrien Helvétius, for example. In his “A Treatise on Man,” Helvetius writes, “Man is born ignorant; he is not born a fool; and it is not even without labour that he is made one.”  Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Single. One,” it added for emphasis.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False While McConnell has declined to take up a number of bills related to election security, the Senate passed the Defending Elections Against Trolls from Enemy Regimes (DETER) Act on June 3. Congress also allocated $380 million to shore up election security in the 2018 omnibus with McConnell’s support. Fact Check:  This post from Occupy Democrats, which received nearly 12,000 shares on Facebook, echoes concerns among Democrats who say that McConnell has not done enough to protect the country from foreign interference in the upcoming election.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Leader McConnell would just like the issue to go away,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recently told The New York Times. “We’re not going to let that happen.” As majority leader, McConnell has wide discretion when it comes to deciding what legislation makes it to the Senate floor. As of late, he has refused to take up a number of bills related to election security, including H.R. 1, a sweeping proposal from House Democrats that, in part, would enhance security measures. McConnell has defended his position by arguing that the true intent of many of the bills is to transfer control of elections from state and local authorities to the federal government. “I’m open to considering legislation, but it has to be directed in a way that doesn’t undermine state and local control of elections. The Democrats … would like to nationalize everything. They want the federal government to take over broad swaths of the election process because they think that would somehow benefit them,” he said during a June interview with Fox News host Laura Ingraham.  Nonetheless, McConnell has not blocked “every single piece of legislation” related to election security as the meme suggests. On June 3, the Senate passed the DETER Act by unanimous consent. The legislation would designate “any alien who has engaged, is engaged, or at any time after admission engages in improper interference in a United States election” as either deportable or inadmissible to the U.S.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “As we saw in the 2016 elections, Vladimir Putin’s Russia is attempting to strike at the very heart of the democratic values, freedoms, and liberty all Americans hold dear,” Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a cosponsor of the bill, said in a statement. “By barring foreigners who improperly interfere in our elections from coming to the United States, the DETER Act sends a message to hostile nations across the world that the United States will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections.” McConnell also supported the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, an omnibus spending bill that included $380 million to improve election security at the state level. As of Sept. 30, about 8 percent of the money had been spent, with most of it going towards cybersecurity and voting equipment. It is projected that 85 percent of the money will be spent ahead of the 2020 presidential election, according to a spokesperson for the Election Assistance Commission.

Fact Check: Sayings are so often misattributed to Jefferson that his estate at Monticello keeps a running list of “spurious quotations.” (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, ‘When Injustice Becomes Law, Resistance Becomes Duty’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A quick Google search reveals that this quotation appears in that list – Monticello investigated it more than a decade ago, finding the words nowhere in Jefferson’s collected works. “Its true origins are uncertain, but the saying may have entered popular culture during the Vietnam era,” it writes on its website, to signify opposition to the war. In a 1969 speech at Columbia University, New York City Mayor John Lindsay said, “The fact is that this dissent is the highest form of patriotism. It is the peaceful American way to turn the nation away from a self-defeating course.” Variations of the quote date back to the early 1900s, according to research by etymologist Barry Popik. “Many times the highest form of civic patriotism lies in criticising your town for all you are worth,” reads one variation that appeared in The Zanesville Signal in 1925.

(RELATED: Viral Image Credits Ben Franklin With This Quote On Justice) Blaine McCormick, a professor at Baylor University and author of “Ben Franklin: America’s Original Entrepreneur,” told the Caller that the quote was actually penned by Stuber as part of an essay discussing Franklin’s life and legacy.

Fact Check: This picture attempts to cast Sanger, an early proponent of birth control, as an icon of racism and the KKK. (RELATED: Does This Photo Show ‘Women Of The Democrat Party’ In KKK Robes?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    She did once speak before a women’s chapter of the KKK, saying in her autobiography that “any aroused group was a good group.” However, this image does not capture that visit – the picture has been doctored. The original photo, tracked down by Snopes in 2015, shows KKK members saluting a cross, not Sanger. The superimposed image of Sanger is from 1931, taken before she testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In Sanger’s autobiography, she describes the speaking engagement with the women’s chapter in detail, calling it “one of the weirdest experiences I had in lecturing.” “Never before had I looked into a sea of faces like these,” she wrote. “I was sure that if I uttered one word, such as abortion, outside the usual vocabulary of these women they would go off into hysteria. And so my address that night had to be in the most elementary terms, as though I were trying to make children understand.”  The image shared on Facebook claims that Sanger “described her experience with elation” and then quotes from the autobiography, yet the tone of her account was not particularly flattering. The meme does accurately quote one excerpt from the book: “In the end, through simple illustrations I believed I had accomplished my purpose. A dozen invitations to speak to similar groups were proffered.” (It excludes the phrase “through simple illustrations,” however.)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  The doctored image appears to have originated with an art contest. Hosted online by an anti-Sanger website, participants were asked to recreate the lecture she gave before the KKK chapter in “unique artistic ways.” Follow Aryssa on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Cahill | Contributor share on facebook tweet this show commentsAn image shared on Facebook claims that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “Waiting hours longer in the waiting room will allow you to make new friends.” Screenshot/Facebook “Yes, she actually said this,” reads the meme.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False The quote originated on a satire website in 2014. There is no evidence that Pelosi ever said this. Fact Check: On Jan. 16, 2014, Reuters reported that wait times for emergency care could increase under Obamacare, citing a report by emergency physicians.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    That same day, an article appeared, supposedly penned by Pelosi herself, that addressed this prospect directly. “I doubt such dire fears will ever come true,” it quotes her as saying. “But for argument’s sake let us presume I am wrong (which I never am) and that ‘Obamacare’ will force Americans to wait in emergency rooms longer than they already do. In that case, has it ever occurred to people the great new friends that can be made while waiting for hours in abject misery alongside others also in abject pain and misery?” At the top of the article, Pelosi is quoted as making the remark found in the meme. If these words sound far-fetched, that’s because they come from Duh Progressive, a political satire website. Pelosi’s office told Politifact in 2014 that the congresswoman never made this statement, and we found no news clips or press reports suggesting that she did. Though Duh Progressive has a disclaimer noting that it’s a satire website, the meme shared on Facebook not only fails to issue a similar warning, it deceptively insists that the quote is real.   share on facebook tweet this show commentsJ.

Verdict: False  The images featured in the collage show Brazilian, not American, politicians sleeping during marathon voting sessions or as a result of other extenuating circumstances. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The image was shared amid reports that the House of Representatives was considering the first cost-of-living increase for its members in a decade. The caption accompanying the image suggests the measure is set pass in that chamber, but House Democrats have postponed consideration of the raise, facing backlash from politically vulnerable lawmakers. The salary bump, if implemented, would increase the pay of rank-and-file lawmakers to $178,500, up 2.6% from the $174,000 they currently make. At least one poll suggests that most voters are strongly opposed to the idea. Though the Facebook post claims to show members of the House sleeping on the job, Snopes determined that these photos actually show Brazilian politicians. The pictures were taken during exceptional situations such as hunger strikes – depicted in the photo on the bottom right – and marathon sessions of voting and debate, like the 41-hour stretch pictured on the bottom left. By performing a reverse image search on Google, a number of these photos can be found in contemporaneous reporting by Brazilian news outlets.  Snopes reported that before circulating among American social media users, the collage was widely shared online in Brazil.

America is great because America is good. If America ever ceases to be good America will cease to be great.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “#Remember,” one user captioned the image. Verdict: False This quotation does not appear in any of Tocqueville’s writings. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “Democracy in America,” Tocqueville’s most famous work, is often referenced when discussing early American society. Written in two volumes published in 1835 and 1840, it recounts Tocqueville’s nine months spent traveling and observing the U.S. It has also been cited as the source of this quote, which has been shared for decades by major political figures, including Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. However, the remarks do not appear in “Democracy in America,” or any of his other writings. Robert Tracy McKenzie, a history professor at Wheaton College, told The Daily Caller that the quote is spurious. “It has been debunked numerous times over the last 67 years or so – no serious Tocqueville scholar believes that he wrote anything remotely similar, nor does it capture the essence of what he believed about the success of democracy in the United States,” he said in an email.  John Pitney Jr., a professor at Claremont McKenna College, debunked the spurious quotation in 1995, saying in The Weekly Standard, “It’s a shame that politicians are using a knockoff product when the real thing is so fine. Democracy in America offers profound analyses of the roles of religion, morality, and voluntary action, though its insights are subtler than the purple prose of the counterfeit.” The quote dates back to at least 1922, according to etymologist Barry Popik, though he found a variant appearing in print as early as the 1880s.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “I sought everywhere in vain for the secret of their success, until I entered the church,” reads this variation. “It was there, as I listened to the soul-equalizing and soul-elevating principles of the Gospel of Christ, as they fell from Sabbath to Sabbath upon the masses of the people, that I learned why America was great and free, and why France was a slave.” McKenzie believes the last two lines originated even earlier, with a variant written by Andrew Reed and James Matheson, English ministers who wrote about their travels to the U.S. in the 1830s. “America will be great if America is good. If not, her greatness will vanish away like a morning cloud,” reads their account, published in 1835. “Here, almost certainly, is the long-lost germ of the ‘words to live by’ that Americans have long attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville,” said McKenzie.

No news outlets have reported on it, and the photos used in the meme are miscaptioned. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Trump attended the New York Military Academy (NYMA) for high school and graduated in 1964. This post, representing itself as a news clipping, claims that during his time there, Trump may have taken a test to measure his IQ, or intelligence quotient. “The results of an IQ test that President Donald Trump allegedly took during his first year at New York Military Academy have been discovered in a file box in a closet in Brooklyn. According to the test results, Trump’s IQ is 73,” the image reads. The post claims that someone named William Askew Jr. uncovered the document while clearing out his late father’s home. “Dad was the school counselor at NYMA from 1955 to 1985,” it quotes him as saying. “He didn’t administer these tests, but he was in charge of collecting them and sending them to the grading office.” Trump is notorious for touting his intelligence, so if the post were true, it would be a bombshell – an IQ score in the low 70s is significantly below average. “Nearly 70 percent of the population has an IQ between 85 and 115 on most tests,” reads the website for MENSA.  However, no news outlets have covered this story, and it appears nowhere credible online. The story is a hoax. There’s one other indication that the story is fake. The meme claims to show photos of Askew and his father, yet both are miscaptioned. As reported by Snopes, the supposed picture of Askew comes from a stock photo website, labelled “portrait of an elderly man.” The image captioned as Askew’s father is actually of Lawrence Hanson, then-principal of Grand Forks Central High School in North Dakota.

The words were superimposed onto a 2013 image of Evans wearing a plain white Under Armour t-shirt. Fact Check: Evans, star of the popular “Captain America” and “Avengers” films, has been politically vocal in recent years, publicly supporting Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. In March, outlets reported that he would be launching a bipartisan political website called “A Starting Point” with the stated goal of creating “informed, responsible, and empathetic citizens.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This meme, which first appeared after President Donald Trump was elected president, shows Evans wearing a t-shirt that bears the statement: “Nope. I won’t stop whining or suck it up. Your vote supported a xenophobic, sexist, hate-filled, anti-gay, anti-choice platform. This is morally unacceptable to me and I proudly stand by my values.” (RELATED: Did Morgan Freeman Say He Hates The Word ‘Homophobia’?) The image, however, has been altered. The original, taken in 2013, shows Evans and one-time love interest Minka Kelly walking together, according to The Daily Mail. The photo has been cropped and photoshopped, with the original depicting Evans wearing a plain white Under Armour t-shirt. There is no evidence that Evans has ever said, written or worn clothing that bears the statement found in the meme.

Fact Check: The remark initially surfaced in August 2017, part of a since-deleted article posted on the site LockerDome.com by an account using the name “Happy Gilmore,” as Sports Illustrated reported. It emerged during the controversy surrounding the decision of many NFL players to sit or kneel during the National Anthem in protest of racial injustice. The quote, however, is fake. “Alleged comments by #Steelers LB @jharrison9292 on social media today regarding any protests are false & should not be used as a reference,” Burt Lauten, director of communications for the Steelers, tweeted at the time.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });     Alleged comments by #Steelers LB @jharrison9292 on social media today regarding any protests are false & should not be used as a reference. — Burt Lauten (@SteelersPRBurt) August 14, 2017  Soon after it appeared, Harrison confirmed that he never made the statement, expressing his true feelings about the protests to Sports Illustrated. “That’s up to the individual,” Harrison said of players declining to stand during the National Anthem. “If they feel like that’s something they want to do, that’s their right.” At the time, Harrison was playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers. He announced his retirement from professional football in April 2018 after a 15-season NFL career during which he won two Super Bowls.

Well doesn’t that tell you something,” one user captioned the photo. Verdict: False While this image does show Soros’ son, Alexander, Markle is not pictured. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Ahead of President Donald Trump’s state visit to Britain and before debate erupted over whether Trump called Markle “nasty,” this image re-emerged after previously being used to claim that Soros and Markle both attended a “spirit cooking” event in 2013. There’s one major problem, though: the woman pictured is not Markle. Rather, it is a woman named Hannah Motley. The man in the image is Alexander Soros, son of billionaire philanthropist and Democratic donor George Soros. Motley appears to be the daughter of Joel Motley, chairman emeritus on the board of Human Rights Watch. According to contemporaneous reporting from The Wall Street Journal, the photo shows Motley and Soros attending an avant-garde art experience in the Hamptons. It had nothing to do with Trump or the British royal family and took place nearly six years before Trump’s recent state visit. Markle, who was an actress before marrying into the royal family, was not present during Trump’s meetings with the queen and other family members. She welcomed her first child, Archie, in early May.

Adam Schiff has a sister who is married to Robert Soros, son of billionaire investor George Soros.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False Schiff does not have a sister. He and Melissa Schiff, Robert Soros’ estranged wife, are not related. Fact Check: George Soros, a Hungarian-American investor who donates to a variety of progressive causes through his Open Society Foundations, has been at the center of conspiracy theories for years. (RELATED: Was Kavanaugh Accuser Deborah Ramirez A Soros Fellow?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This particular claim emerged online around December 2017, circulating on social media. “YOU CAN’T MAKE THIS UP,” reads the caption at the bottom of the meme. Soros’ eldest son, Robert, did marry a Melissa Schiff, according to a May 1992 wedding announcement in The New York Times. However, the two Schiffs have different parents. Melissa Schiff is the daughter of Haskel and Marlene Schiff, according to the wedding announcement, whereas Adam Schiff is the son of Edward and Sherrill Schiff. He and Melissa Schiff are not related, his congressional office told The Daily Caller. Adam Schiff only has one sibling, a brother named Daniel. (RELATED: Was The FBI Agent Leading The Vegas Shooter Investigation John Podesta’s Son-In-Law?)  Robert Soros and Melissa Schiff have been estranged for several years. Soros filed for divorce in 2014, after allegedly starting an affair with artist Meredith Ostrom. It’s unclear if that divorce has been finalized. The New York Post reported in September 2017 that the couple had begun their divorce trial in Manhattan Supreme Court, settling a dispute over their art collection and $5.85 million Rhinebeck, New York farm.

Verdict: False  There is no evidence that Bannon ever made this statement. Fact Check:   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Bannon served as chief executive for the Trump campaign and, after Trump’s 2016 election victory, chief strategist in the White House. Described as a “populist firebrand,” he directed his ire at so-called “globalists” and cast figures like former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as members of a “corrupt elite.” The National Liberty Federation has a history of spreading misinformation through its memes, with this post alleging that Bannon once predicted jail time for members of the Obama administration. “I wouldn’t be surprised if by the end of President Trump’s first term you see multiple people from Barack Obama’s administration, if not he himself, in Federal prison,” it quotes him as saying. However, there is no evidence that Bannon ever made this statement. Though the quote has been circulating online since at least 2017, an internet search revealed no credible sources linking it to him. Bannon and the White House parted ways in August 2017, seven months into the Trump administration.  Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  New Jersey filed a lawsuit against Purdue in October 2017. CNBC has since updated its reporting, noting that Nebraska and Michigan are the only two states that have not sued the pharmaceutical giant. Fact Check:  Based in Connecticut, Purdue is best known for making the opioid pain medication OxyContin. The drug, intended to help those with severe pain, eventually became one of the most abused drugs on the market. It has been widely linked to the ongoing opioid crisis gripping the country. Purdue faces a bevy of lawsuits from state and local governments alleging that the company engaged in deceptive marketing practices. California, Hawaii, Idaho and Maine are among the latest states to file lawsuits against the company, bringing the total number that have sued to 48.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A number of states have also sued members of the Sackler family, the owners of Purdue. “Purdue and the Sacklers traded the health and well-being of Californians for profit and created an unprecedented national public health crisis in the process,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said at a press conference announcing the lawsuit. “We will hold them accountable.” For its part, Purdue has decried what it calls “misleading attacks” against the company. “Such allegations demand clear evidence linking the conduct alleged to the harm described,” spokesperson Robert Josephson said, according to The Associated Press. “But we believe the state fails to show such causation and offers little evidence to support its sweeping legal claims.”  Reporting on these developments, the June 4 article from CNBC initially identified New Jersey as one of the states that had not sued the company. “New Jersey, which has filed a lawsuit against the Sackler family, and Michigan are the only two states that have not sued Purdue,” read one line of the story. However, New Jersey did file a lawsuit against the OxyContin maker back in 2017, according to a press release from the attorney general’s office.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “When we point the finger of blame for the deadly epidemic that has killed thousands in New Jersey, Purdue is in the bullseye of the target,” then-Attorney General Christopher Porrino said at the time. “Today, my office took the first step toward holding them legally and financially responsible for their deception.” Nebraska is the only other state besides Michigan that has not pursued litigation against the company. CNBC apparently confused New Jersey for the cornhusker state. After being contacted by The Daily Caller News Foundation, the news outlet issued a correction, updating its story to reflect the correct states. Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

So thoughtful, you know. We’ve had some private talks and he is very genuine. I have a sense about people, and the president has a good heart. In another life, he could be my son.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence that the queen made such a statement. She rarely gives interviews or speaks publicly about politics. Fact Check: This post appeared in response to Trump’s state visit to the U.K., where he met with British leaders, including the royal family.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    We traced the quote back to The Clover Chronicle, a site that shares conspiratorial news stories. “A staffer at an unnamed MSM news outlet in the United Kingdom is claiming they were recently involved in an interview with Queen Elizabeth II where she unexpectedly complimented U.S. President Donald Trump,” it wrote June 4. “The alleged insider said executives at the organization are ‘fuming’ because they couldn’t salvage the piece due to her relentless praise of the POTUS.” The claim also appears on 4 Chan, posted anonymously. The quote is immediately dubious because the queen rarely gives interviews. The BBC managed to secure a January 2018 documentary with the queen, which one of the producers says took more than two decades to arrange. Described as a “conversation,” the interviewer wasn’t allowed to ask any direct questions. Furthermore, the queen is historically apolitical in public. She remained silent about Brexit, for example, except for what many interpreted as vague allusions when asking for Britons to find “common ground.” It is therefore unlikely that the queen would have spoken about Trump in a positive, or negative, light.  “As Head of State The Queen has to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters, unable to vote or stand for election,” the royal family’s website reads.

Christians are too moral for business.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Behind the quote appears the cover of Trump’s 1987 book “The Art of the Deal.” Verdict: False There is no evidence of Trump saying this statement, in “The Art of the Deal” or anywhere else. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Trump’s presidential campaign was buoyed not only by his reputation as a dealmaker and businessman, but also his support among Evangelical voters. Had Trump made such a statement, it would have likely alienated a voting bloc important to his 2016 election victory. However, there is no evidence of this being a legitimate quote from Trump. Though his every word is closely followed by the press, The Daily Caller did not find any news reports containing the statement. The words “atheism” and “Christian” do not appear anywhere in “The Art of the Deal,” and the Caller found nothing in the book that reflected a similar sentiment. The man who wrote the book with Trump, ghostwriter Tony Schwartz, has been openly critical of the president and expressed regret for his role in penning the best-selling book that helped Trump further his fame.

It appears to have originated with a satirical article. Fact Check: While much has been said about Trump and the fact that he did not serve in the Vietnam War – he received four deferments for college and one for bone spurs – there is no indication that the quote attributed to him is legitimate.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The full text reads, “Sure, I got deferments. But — excuse me, Chuck, let me finish. Would you really want a president who was dumb enough to let himself get drafted? I mean, it wasn’t hard to get out of it, believe me. My doctor said I had a bump on my heel or something. I don’t know. I don’t even think he was a doctor, frankly. The government is just very, very stupid. OK? Which is why only I can fix it.” The meme claims that Trump said it on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Aug. 28, 2015, so a couple months after announcing his candidacy for president. The show did not air that day, but Trump did appear on “Meet the Press” almost two weeks earlier. The Vietnam War did not come up. In the instances where he has discussed the war, Trump has never been quoted as making the statement attributed to him in the meme. The quote appears to have originated in an August 2016 piece by Yahoo News columnist Matt Bai titled, “Is there anything Trump could say to make his party cut and run?”  While the article is not labeled as satire, it contains many clearly satirical quotes attributed to Republican leaders. For example, it quotes former House Speaker Paul Ryan explaining why he can’t take back his endorsement of Trump. “There’s no backsies,” it fictitiously quotes him as saying. “I put the sticker on my car already. It’s not one of those magnet deals. It’s really on there. I’d have to repaint the entire bumper.” The article claims to be an “excerpt” from a 2022 book published by Yahoo University Press, which obviously does not exist.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Follow Aryssa on Twitter  Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: While Twain authored many famous quotations, this oft-shared maxim on the power of kindness is not a Twain original. Nowhere in his written body of work does such a phrase appear. (RELATED: Did Mark Twain Compare Politicians To Diapers?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Furthermore, scholars have noted that the saying doesn’t even sound like Twain. “If the aphorism in question indicates a sentimental, nostalgic, or otherwise optimistic attitude towards humanity, it probably didn’t come from Twain,” the Center for Mark Twain Studies wrote in 2017 when debunking this quote. The expression has been in existence since the 19th century, according to the website Quote Investigator, with slight variations in some of the earlier references, like using the word “dumb” instead of “blind.” Christian Nestell Bovee often receives credit for the quote. “Kindness: a language which the dumb can speak and the deaf can understand,” he wrote in his 1857 book “Thoughts, Feelings, and Fancies.” Quote Investigator found instances of the saying being circulated in newspapers within years of this book. The first known attribution to Twain was printed in 1942.  “Currently, there is no substantive evidence that Mark Twain wrote or said a version of this expression,” the site concluded. “He was connected to the saying decades after his death.” Follow Aryssa on Twitter   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Have a fact check suggestion?

At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve,” he wrote of his visit, before penning the words that appear in the meme. “‘But suppose God is black,’ I replied. ‘What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white?

Last night, we outlined 6 ways to reform the justice system: 1⃣End a war on drugs that has become a war on people 2⃣End the prohibition on marijuana 3⃣Expunge the records of those locked away for possessing it 4⃣Eliminate private prisons 5⃣End mandatory minimums 6⃣End cash bail pic.twitter.com/gsCYeI4mKf — Beto O’Rourke (@BetoORourke) May 22, 2019  Verdict: False  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  While Iowa’s incarcerated population is disproportionately black, a 2018 report from the state’s Department of Human Rights estimated that around 25 percent of those incarcerated are black, not 40 percent. About 4 percent of the population in Iowa is black, according to Census Bureau data. Fact Check:  O’Rourke mentioned the stat while laying out his plan for criminal justice reform, which includes eliminating private prisons and ending the cash bail system, among other policy changes. O’Rourke said the current criminal justice system has disproportionately affected black Americans, using the prison population in Iowa as an example. “I was talking to somebody in Iowa, Tavis Hall, who is an expert on this. He said African Americans comprise 3 percent of Iowa’s population, 40 percent of the incarcerated population in this state,” he said May 21.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    O’Rourke wasn’t far off the mark with the first stat – in July 2018, 3.8 percent of Iowa’s population were black or African American alone, according to Census Bureau data. However, the second figure is incorrect. Looking at state prisons, Iowa does have one of the highest rates of incarceration for blacks in the country, but a report from the state’s Department of Human Rights estimates that about 24.5 percent of those incarcerated in fiscal year 2018 were black, not the 40 percent O’Rourke cited. The figure has decreased slightly over the last decade.   Similarly, the Prison Policy Initiative released a 2014 report that found that 23 percent of the state’s incarcerated population was black, relying on 2010 Census Bureau data. (This figure accounts for all types of correctional facilities in the state, including local jails.)  And an April report published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics concluded that 2,183 out of 9,024 prisoners held in state or federal facilities at the end of 2017 were black, about 24 percent. O’Rourke cited Tavis Hall, executive director at Experience Waterloo, a nonprofit that promotes tourism in Waterloo, Iowa, as the source of the figure. When contacted by The Daily Caller News Foundation, however, Hall said the 40 percent statistic was incorrect.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  “I did speak with Mr. ORourke [sic] in early May about a slew of issues facing Iowa and the country, including the disproportionate incarceration of African Americans,” he said in an email to TheDCNF. “We talked about the rate of incarceration, student loans and other impacts of incarceration, as well as other issues of small town blackness in America. During that conversation, I did reference 40% incarceration rate. Those numbers are specific to Black Hawk County, where I reside. Unfortunately, I did unintentionally conflate the state number and the Black Hawk County statistic.” The Black Hawk County Sheriff’s Office reported that 37 percent of jail inmates in 2017 were black, whereas the black community makes up about 10 percent of the population in that county. In response to the disproportionate incarceration of blacks, groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have advocated for, among other policy changes, the decriminalization of drug possession across the state and expanded social services for mental health and substance abuse. “Our state must take major steps to create a criminal justice system that is fair and impartial for all Iowans, no matter the color of their skin,” Mark Stringer, executive director of the ACLU of Iowa, said in a statement to TheDCNF. Lynn Hicks, the communications director for the Iowa attorney general’s office, acknowledged the disparity, but emphasized steps the state has taken to address it. “We don’t dispute that there has been a disparate impact on minorities in Iowa, and African-Americans in particular. However, few states have done as much as Iowa to address this disparity in recent years. The Iowa Attorney General’s Office has spearheaded reform efforts beginning in 2014,” he told TheDCNF in an email. He pointed to multiple laws passed in recent years, including one that allows some nonviolent drug offenders to become eligible for parole after serving at least half of the mandatory minimum sentence, and another that allows, subject to certain conditions, a misdemeanor offense to be expunged after a given period of time.

Fact Check: In 1961, President John F. Kennedy spoke before the Canadian Parliament, capping off his speech with a popular expression: “As the great parliamentarian Edmund Burke said, ‘The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, this saying, which predates Kennedy’s presidency and continues to be shared to this day, cannot be found in any of Burke’s writings. According to the website Quote Investigator, the expression was attributed to Burke in the 14th edition of “Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations,” erroneously citing a letter from 1795, but the book was later amended. “Even though it is clear by now that Burke is unlikely to have made this observation, no one has ever been able to determine who did,” Ralph Keyes, author of the book “The Quote Verifier,” wrote on the subject. What Burke did say was, “When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.” Published in 1770, this may be the inspiration for the quotation that appears in the meme.  The saying bears closer resemblance to the words of English philosopher John Stuart Mill, who in the 1860s wrote, “Bad men need nothing more to compass their ends, than that good men should look on and do nothing.” Isaac Kramnick, a professor emeritus at Cornell University who has studied Burke, told The Daily Caller in an email, “I know the quote. I know it’s attributed to Burke. But I know that I have never seen it in his oeuvre.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Jesse Norman, a member of the British Parliament who authored a book on the philosopher, told the Caller, “As far as I am aware Burke never said this.” Etymologist Barry Popik has found attributions to Burke dating back to 1920.

It’s not a phobia. You’re not scared. You’re an a**hole.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Freeman ever making such a statement. The true origin appears to be a parody account on Twitter. Fact Check: June is Pride Month in the U.S., and many Facebook users are eager to share quotes showing their support for the LGBTQ community, including this particular post, which has been shared more than 250 times.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The quote featured in the image, however, does not actually come from Freeman. No such statement appears on his official Facebook page, and Freeman does not have a public Twitter account. The Daily Caller could not find a particular interview or movie in which he said this. The quote appears to have come from @MorgonFreeman, a parody account on Twitter that has since been suspended. The earliest known instances of the quote date back to 2012.

You get your House back, your Car back, your Job back, your Country back!”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no evidence to suggest that Daniels ever made this statement. A spokesperson told The Daily Caller News Foundation that the quote is not genuine. Fact Check: Daniels, an award-winning singer and songwriter whose band came to prominence in the 1970s, has written and performed music in genres ranging from southern rock to gospel, but is best known for his 1979 hit “The Devil Went Down To Georgia.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    He has occasionally weighed in on politics, though not always for the same side of the aisle. In the 1970s, Daniels and his band played a series of benefits concerts for then-Democratic presidential candidate Jimmy Carter, according to a 1978 article in The Free Lance-Star. “I didn’t know if he would be president but he was a straight talker. I believed in what he stood for,” Daniels said of Carter. Since then, Daniels has shifted to the right. He published multiple open letters criticizing former President Barack Obama. “Your petulance is unbecoming, Mr. President, and your criticism of anyone who disagrees with you is downright unmanly,” he wrote in one such letter. “You come off like a spoiled child who has been denied his way.” Daniels often writes about politics on a section of his band’s website called the “soap box,” and his Twitter account is generally supportive of Trump.  However, there is no evidence that Daniels ever said the quote about voting for Trump. It appears nowhere credible online, and a publicist for The Charlie Daniels Band told TheDCNF that the quote does not belong to the country music star.

If we can undermine these three areas, America will collapse from within.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Stalin ever saying or writing this. Fact Check: This quote has floated around the internet for years. Former presidential candidate Ben Carson even attributed a similar expression to Stalin in 2016 and was quickly fact-checked for it.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The meme suggests that so long as Americans remain patriotic and upstanding, the country will persevere. There is, however, no evidence of Stalin ever saying the statement attributed to him. “It doesn’t sound very Stalinist,” Robert Gellately, a history professor at Florida State University who has written about Stalin, told The Daily Caller in an email. A search of his collected works returned no such quotation. The meme may have gained new currency in the last couple years, with reports that Russian actors used social media to sow division among Americans ahead of, and after, the 2016 presidential election. “The ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum – touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights,” Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook, told The Guardian in 2017.

Fact Check: Tillerson’s tenure as secretary of state, which lasted from February 2017 to March 2018, was overshadowed by the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. He did speak before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee multiple times – first when being considered for the cabinet position and again in October 2017.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, there is no evidence that Tillerson ever made the remark attributed to him in the meme.

During his confirmation hearing, Tillerson said that while the U.S. should seek common ground with Russia, it must remain “clear eyed” about its relationship with the geopolitical adversary. “Where important differences remain, we should be steadfast in defending the interest of America and her allies,” he said in January 2017. “Russia must know that we will be accountable to our commitments and those of our allies and that Russia must be held to account for its actions.” Follow Aryssa on Twitter   Have a fact check suggestion?

His estate at Mount Vernon has listed the quotation as “spurious.” Fact Check: Washington and other founding fathers are popular targets for misattribution, this case included. While Washington’s governing prowess is well-regarded, there is no evidence he ever said the remark in question. (RELATED: Did George Washington Say This Quote About A ‘Government’s Right To Govern’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    “The quote is frequently misattributed to Washington,” Washington’s estate at Mount Vernon says on its website. “The origin of the misquote is, perhaps, a mention of a similar statement in a biography of Washington first published in 1835. However, the quote that appeared in the biography has never been proven to have come from Washington.” In that biography, written by James Kirke Paulding, the author claims that Washington said, “It is impossible to govern the universe without the aid of a Supreme Being.” Neither the quote claimed by Paulding nor the quote in the image appear in a collection of Washington’s writings or in any of his recorded speeches. When discussing the role of religion in Washington’s life, Mount Vernon noted that he “did see God as guiding the creation of the United States,” but there is debate over whether Washington considered himself an orthodox Christian.

The only election should be for President.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  The meme cites a Nov. 5 appearance on Fox News. Verdict: False There is no evidence of Trump saying this, on cable television or anywhere else. A representative for the Trump Organization said the quote is fake. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    While Trump and his siblings have frequently appeared on the cable news networks during their father’s presidency, this quote does not reflect the comments of Trump, in November or at any other time. The Daily Caller found no evidence of him making this remark, which would have likely been covered by news outlets, especially during a contentious midterm election cycle. “That quote is absolutely fake,” Kimberly Benza, executive assistant to Trump, told the Caller in an email. Furthermore, the assertion that the country’s founders meant for the president to appoint governors, senators, et cetera, defies the process laid out in the Constitution.  Trump did appear on Fox Business on the date noted in the meme, but he discussed his father’s record and the electoral prospects of Republicans ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. “Assuming Republicans get out, assuming Trump supporters get out, and they vote for the Republican ticket, we’re going to have an amazing night tomorrow,” Trump said of the impending elections, in which the Democrats took the House and the Republicans kept the Senate.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Follow Aryssa on Twitter  Have a fact check suggestion?

Dianne Feinstein said a gunman will lay down his arms if no one else is armed.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “When the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in…. that’s just human nature,” reads the alleged quote. Verdict: False There is no record of Feinstein ever saying this. The quote appears to have originated on a now-defunct satirical website. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Feinstein has been a vocal supporter of gun control for decades. In the 1990s, she authored the now-expired assault weapons ban that limited the types of firearms Americans could purchase. The California senator has repeatedly sought to enact gun control legislation, including an updated version of the ban. “Without stronger laws to prevent straw purchasing and close the gaping holes in our background check system, a presumptive murderer barely has to lift a finger to buy a gun,” Feinstein said after the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California. However, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence to suggest Feinstein ever made the statement attributed to her in the meme. An online search revealed nothing credible resembling the quote. (RELATED: Did Dianne Feinstein Say It’s Legal To Hunt Humans With 30-Round Magazines?) The quote has circulated online for years, and the satirical website The Palookaville Post appears to be the source. Although the site is no longer accessible, a February 2013 article – “Feinstein and Boxer Ask Californians to Lay Down Their Weapons During Statewide Manhunt” – contained the quote:  “The Senators feel the best course of action is to remove all weapons from law enforcement and private citizens so no one else gets hurt,” reads a fabricated quote, attributed to a Senate communications intern. “When the gunman realizes that nobody else is armed, he will lay down his weapons and turn himself in … that’s just human nature.” Follow Brad on Twitter  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Have a fact check suggestion?

Versions of the expression have existed since at least the early 1700s. Fact Check: Although Churchill is eminently quotable, there is no evidence that he originated this particular saying. The quote does not appear in a selection of writings about Churchill or any of his speeches or books. (RELATED: Did Winston Churchill Say This Quote About Muslims?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The website Quote Investigator traced a variation of the maxim back to the early 18th century, attributable to author Jonathan Swift, who wrote, “Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it.” The quote has appeared in various forms over the years. Richard Langworth, a senior fellow at the Hillsdale College Churchill Project, credited Cordell Hull, President Franklin Roosevelt’s secretary of state, with a similar expression: “A lie will gallop halfway round the world before the truth has time to pull its breeches on.” Many decades earlier, in 1855, the preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon cited another variation of the saying that swapped out the word “pants” with “boots.” “In conclusion,” Quote Investigator writes, “there exists a family of expressions contrasting the dissemination of lies and truths, and these adages have been evolving for more than 300 years.”  Follow Aryssa on Twitter  Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False  There is no record of Jefferson ever saying or writing this phrase. It is included in the Thomas Jefferson Foundation’s list of spurious quotations. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Turning Point will often share historical quotes to lend support to its political outlook. “Thomas Jefferson Agreed That Big Gov SUCKS!” reads the caption of the meme. The problem is that some of the quotes it uses are not, in fact, genuine. (RELATED: Did Thomas Jefferson Say, ‘That Government Is Best Which Governs The Least’?) This meme is one such case. While Jefferson was a proponent of limited government – “I am for a government rigorously frugal & simple,” he wrote in 1799 – The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that Jefferson ever said or wrote the expression shared in the meme. It can’t be found in any of Jefferson’s writings, and the Thomas Jefferson Foundation includes the quote on its list of “spurious quotations.” A slightly longer version of the quote says, “My reading of history convinces me that most bad government has grown out of too much government.” It appears to have originated in a series of lectures delivered by politician John Sharp Williams. The speeches were published in 1913 in the form of a book titled “Thomas Jefferson: His Permanent Influence on American Institutions.” The book contains the phrase in question, but the lectures were written about Jefferson, not by him. The first known attribution in print to Jefferson dates back to 1950, according to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. It bears slight resemblance to a phrase Jefferson did once write: “History, in general, only informs us what bad government is.”  Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said the U.S. doesn’t have to worry about Chinese missile attacks because of the difference in time zones between the two countries.   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “We’ll never have to worry about China attacking us! They are 12 hours ahead, so we’ll have plenty of time to shoot down their missiles!” reads the alleged quote. Verdict: False There is no evidence that Ocasio-Cortez ever made this statement. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Ocasio-Cortez came to national prominence after defeating 10-term incumbent Joe Crowley to represent New York’s 14th congressional district. She is a self-described democratic socialist and, at 29, is the youngest woman to ever be elected to Congress. She has also drawn the ire of her critics, with this particular meme created to question her intelligence. “Did she REALLY say that? Yep, you’re looking at the future of the Democrat party…” the image reads. However, The Daily Caller News Foundation found no evidence that she ever said the alleged quote. The meme does not cite any source and has been circulating the internet since at least September. (RELATED: Did Ocasio-Cortez Really Say This About Ben Shapiro?) Corbin Trent, a spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign, told FactCheck.org last year that the quote was fabricated. “She’s never even discussed Chinese missiles. Period,” he said. “Her foreign policy topics have been about peace not war.”  A section of her campaign website titled “A Peace Economy” lays out her general foreign policy stances. “Alexandria believes that we must end the ‘forever war’ by bringing our troops home, and ending the air strikes that perpetuate the cycle of terrorism throughout the world,” it reads. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Missile Defense Project, China is “in the process of building and deploying a sophisticated and modern missile arsenal” and has a “relatively small but developing contingent of nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking the U.S. homeland.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Follow Brad on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?

So in a sense, your homelessness is a gift from heaven.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no record of Carson making such a statement. Fact Check: During his 2016 presidential campaign, and now his tenure as a cabinet secretary, critics of Carson have pointed to controversial comments he has made; he once compared Obamacare to slavery, for example. But this image, which claims that Carson called homelessness a “gift from heaven,” is false. (RELATED: Did Ben Carson Say, ‘Before Obama, People Barely Noticed Skin Color’?)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    The Daily Caller found no evidence of Carson making such a statement on the campaign trail, while at the Department of Housing and Urban Development or at any other time. The media has not reported on any such statement. The photo of Carson shown in the meme comes from a May 2015 town hall he had in Baltimore, Maryland, yet no reporting about that visit contains the quote in question. Carson has been previously criticized for calling poverty a “state of mind.” “I think poverty to a large extent is also a state of mind,” he said in 2017. “You take somebody who has the right mindset, you can take everything from them and put them on the street and I guarantee you in a little while they’ll be right back up there.

The hoarding of wealth is the cause of poverty. The rich aren’t just indifferent to poverty; they create it and maintain it.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  Verdict: False There is no indication that Foster ever said this quote. Fact Check: This meme suggests that Foster does not live by her own political philosophy, first attributing the quote to her, then pointing out that she herself is well off. Beneath the quote, the image claims that she has a net worth of $100 million, though The Daily Caller could not independently verify whether this figure is accurate or not.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Nonetheless, the Caller found no proof that Foster ever said this – to reporters, on camera or anywhere else. The meme does not provide a source or date for the remark, but it has been circulating on social media for years, at times with no attribution to Foster. Foster does occasionally wade into politics – she has protested against President Donald Trump and directed an ad for the 2018 midterm elections, backed by Independence USA, a PAC funded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. “I have a thousand opinions, and I certainly give money and do a lot of things behind the scenes,” Foster said in a 2018 interview with IndieWire, “but it’s not my personality to believe that celebrities have the expertise to try to influence other people’s ideas or their feelings, politically.”  Follow Aryssa on Twitter  Have a fact check suggestion?

Fact Check: Social media users will often lean upon the prestige of America’s founding fathers by attributing political quotes to them. (RELATED: Did George Washington Say This Quote About A ‘Government’s Right To Govern’)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This image supposedly quotes four founders, each making a remark that is critical of democracy. We looked into the sayings, finding that while two can be ascribed to Adams and Hamilton, the quotes attributed to Jefferson and Franklin are spurious. The saying ascribed to Adams comes from a letter he wrote in 1814. “Remember Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes exhausts and murders itself. There never was a Democracy Yet, that did not commit suicide,” he wrote, before continuing, “It is in vain to Say that Democracy is less vain, less proud, less selfish, less ambitious or less avaricious than Aristocracy or Monarchy. It is not true in Fact and no where appears in history. Those Passions are the same in all Men under all forms of Simple Government, and when unchecked, produce the same Effects of Fraud Violence and Cruelty.” The quote attributed to Hamilton comes from remarks he’s recorded as making during the Constitutional Convention of 1787.  “We are now forming a republican government,” Hamilton said, according to one individual reporting on the event. “Real liberty is neither found in despotism or the extremes of democracy, but in moderate governments.” The meme does not include that final clause, and another attendee who transcribed the same speech did not include the quote in his notes. The quotes from Jefferson and Franklin cannot be traced back to a particular speech or letter, or any written work for that matter.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Jefferson’s estate at Monticello lists the quotation – that “democracy is nothing more than mob rule, where fifty-one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty-nine” – on its list of “spurious quotations,” saying it has “no evidence to confirm that Thomas Jefferson ever said or wrote” this. The quote did not appear in a search of Jefferson’s collected works. The quote ascribed to Franklin says, “Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote.” However, The Daily Caller found no instance of it in Franklin’s writings, nor does the statement appear in the National Archives‘ online database. “I couldn’t readily find the quote in Franklin’s papers,” Thomas Kidd, a history professor at Baylor University, told the Caller in an email. According to etymologist Barry Popik, the first half of the expression can be found in print as far back as 1987. The closest Franklin comes to expressing this sentiment is where he writes in a 1773 letter, “There is Truth in the Old Saying, That if you make yourself a Sheep, the Wolves will eat you.” Follow Aryssa on Twitter  Have a fact check suggestion?

Verdict: False The sign in this image has been altered. The original sign makes no reference to political party and instead says “Lancaster County.” Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    This post attempts to criticize the Democratic Party by associating it with the hate group, and while the party historically had ties to the Klan, particularly in the Deep South, the sign being held has been digitally altered. In the original photo, found on Getty Images, the sign says “Lancaster County.” However, it reads “Women of the Democrat Party” in the image on Facebook, even though the official party name is the Democratic Party. All the other aspects of the image, including the shadow featured on the lower left and the individuals in the upper right background, are the same as the original. The photo shows female members of the KKK from Pennsylvania who came to Washington, D.C., likely for a march. The photo was taken in the 1920s, at a time when many women had organized women’s chapters of the KKK, known as the WKKK. According to sociologist Kathleen Blee, “From 1923 to 1930, women poured into the Klan movement to oppose immigration, racial equality, Jewish-owned businesses, parochial schools, and ‘moral decay.'” (RELATED: When Did Black People Get The Right To Vote?)

It may be a version of a quote by environmentalist writer Edward Abbey. Fact Check: This falsely-attributed quote has been circulating on the internet and elsewhere for years. In fact, Energy Secretary Rick Perry cited Paine as the source of the quote in a February 2015 speech.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    However, there is no record of Paine ever writing or speaking these words; it appears nowhere in his collected works. The quote has come to the attention of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association, which includes it in a list of quotes “NOT from Thomas Paine” on its website. According to etymologist Barry Popik, the quote may have originated with Abbey, an American environmentalist and anarchist author who passed away in 1989. “A patriot must always be ready to defend his country against his government,” he wrote in his 1989 work “A Voice Crying in the Wilderness.”  share on facebook tweet this show commentsTrevor SchakohlFact Check ReporterFollow Trevor on Twitter Have a fact check suggestion?  Send ideas to [email protected].","https://www.facebook.com/libertyheadquarters/photos/a.451425028243722/2450907068295498/?type=3&theater,https://debamboozled.com/2014/02/11/others-5/thomas-paine-the-duty-of-a-true-patriot-is-to-protect-his-country-from-its-government/,https://www.amazon.com/DUTY-PATRIOT-PROTECT-COUNTRY-GOVERNMENT/dp/B015NZ55OM,https://www.politifact.com/virginia/statements/2015/mar/09/rick-perry/rick-perry-errs-tying-patriotism-quote-thomas-pain/,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Paine,https://books.google.com/books?id=2sS8qQBJBaoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=collected+writings+thomas+paine&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNkZKfrL7iAhWRjlkKHUn0A3gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=duty&f=false,http://thomaspaine.org/,http://thomaspaine.org/aboutpaine/did-paine-write-these-quotes.html,https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/it_is_the_duty_of_the_patriot_to_protect_his_country_from_its_government,https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-Abbey,https://books.google.com/books?id=obqSDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+voice+crying+in+the+wilderness&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFo52nxr7iAhWBxFkKHabODToQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=patriot&f=false,https://www.amazon.com/Voice-Crying-Wilderness-Clamantis-Deserto-ebook/dp/B07H191WB8/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2BA5LC4KUJQ5T&keywords=a+voice+crying+in+the+wilderness&qid=1559051540&s=books&sprefix=a+voice+cryi%2Cstripbooks%2C161&sr=1-3,https://twitter.com/tschakohl,/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#384c4a5d4e574a785c595154415b5954545d4a165b5755",Did Thomas Paine Say This Quote About The Duty Of A ‘True Patriot’?,,,,,

The child pictured momentarily stood inside a faux cage set up at the event. Fact Check: While tensions flared in 2018 over the Trump administration’s policy of family separation, a group known as the Brown Berets de Cemanahuac protested in front of city hall in Dallas, Texas.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    A photo from that event – pictured above – went viral, with many suggesting it was of a boy in detention, separated from his family. Others, like commenters on the Facebook post, claimed it was actually a photo taken during the Obama administration. Neither are correct, though. The young boy at the protest went inside a faux cage set up at the June 2018 protest, as reported by Snopes. The image does not show a migrant child detained by the Trump administration. “The little boy wandered in by himself and became upset when he saw his mother on the other side of the fence,” according to Buzzfeed, which spoke to one of the attendees. The child was reportedly behind the fence for less than a minute. Other photographs from the same event show the young boy both inside and outside of the fencing, roaming free. (Politifact was able to nail down the exact photograph of the child, found here.)   Shortly after this protest, the Trump administration backed away from its policy of family separation at the border.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });  Follow Aryssa on Twitter  Have a fact check suggestion?

J. Cahill | Contributor share on facebook tweet this show commentsAn image shared on Facebook claimed that President Donald Trump went “ballistic” during an interview on “Fox and Friends,” with him supposedly saying, “I am in charge, this is my country and I will do as I please.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  It showed a screenshot from the alleged segment, transcribing his full remarks as follows: “The Democrats can subpoena me and my administration for the next 10, 15, 20 years and we will never capitulate. They need to face the fact that I am in charge, this is my country and I will do as I please, they have no control over me. The people support me and will always support me.” Verdict: False There is no evidence that Trump ever made these remarks. The image in question is photoshopped.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Fact Check: Much to the chagrin of Trump, House Democrats have sought to subpoena his financial records, leading to an ongoing legal battle in court. Yet there is no evidence that Trump ever made these comments, on Fox News or anywhere else. He has given many interviews on “Fox and Friends,” however this particular screenshot is doctored and actually comes from an April 25 interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. (The news ticker at the bottom of the screenshot lines up around 10 minutes into the interview.) Instead of the transcript shown in the meme, the on-air graphics simply say, “On the Phone: President Donald Trump.”  A Fox News spokesperson confirmed that the chyron is photoshopped as well, with the original text reading, “Trump: I Want To See What Was On DNC Server,” referring to how the Democratic National Committee went with a private security firm after it was infamously hacked, rather than allow the FBI to examine its servers firsthand.  share on facebook tweet this show commentsJ.

It quotes him as saying, “I can do my job without any intelligence whatsoever.”   googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline1'); });  “His actual quote,” the meme insists. Verdict: False Trump continues to receive intel briefings, according to White House calendars. The quote did not originate with Trump, but with a January satire article about him. Fact Check:  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    In light of reports that Trump “rarely if ever” reads the daily intel brief prepared for the president, this meme takes that sort of reporting a step further by incorrectly stating that Trump stopped taking in-person briefings altogether. (The president’s public schedule still shows the White House holding these meetings.) As far as the quote attributed to Trump, The Daily Caller found no record of him ever making such a statement. The supposed remark actually originated with a satire article by Andy Borowitz of The New Yorker. Written in January, the piece uses wordplay to mock Trump’s intelligence, as “intelligence” can refer to both intellect and the sort of fact-finding done by the CIA. “I’ve listened to these people with so-called intelligence go on and on, and, quite frankly, it’s a waste of time,” it fictitiously quotes Trump as saying. “I know a lot more than people with intelligence do.”  The article continues: “Trump added that he has stopped receiving intelligence briefings at the White House, arguing, ‘I can do my job without any intelligence whatsoever.'” The New Yorker clearly notes that the piece is satire, whereas the Facebook post does the opposite – it insists that Trump actually said this remark.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline3'); });    Per NBC News, an analysis of Trump’s schedule by a former CIA briefer found that he has taken in-person briefings at roughly the same rate as Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.

Fact Check: The picture in question is a still image from CNN’s broadcast of the 2015 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, held in Washington, D.C., on April 25 of that year. (Video of the event can be viewed here.)  googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dailycaller_inline2'); });    Obama was in attendance at the event, appearing many times in the video itself. However, she was wearing a different dress with a much higher neckline than the woman shown in the original image, sporting curled hair in contrast to the other woman’s straighter hairstyle. In addition, the image actually shows attendees standing with their hands over their hearts during a performance of the National Anthem, rather than the Pledge of Allegiance. During this performance, Obama stood on the stage, not on the main floor of the event where the woman in the picture is standing. Obama placed her hand over her heart during the rendition of the anthem. The woman in the image is actually Washington Post columnist Helena Andrews. After receiving backlash for being on her phone, she responded via Twitter, saying she had been taking notes, not texting, when she appeared on camera.
