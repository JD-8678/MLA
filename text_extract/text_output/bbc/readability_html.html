He said that "all trips between non-European countries and EU countries will be suspended".</p><p>Ms von der Leyen said that long-term residents, family members of EU nationals and diplomats would be exempt as well as cross-border and healthcare workers and people transporting goods.</p><p>The measures would be in place for at least 30 days.</p><p>Some 26 states are part of the Schengen agreement, which allows people to move freely between EU countries without border checks, but several countries have unilaterally closed borders in recent days in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>This prompted the commission to propose that the bloc act in a more unified fashion and restrict entry to the union as a whole, on the urging of Mr Macron.</p><p>Citizens of non-Schengen EU member states will also be invited to apply the travel ban. Travel with Switzerland and the UK will be preserved.</p><p>"It is more effective and less disruptive than measures to close borders within Europe, which must be avoided to allow cross-border workers to continue their activity and essential goods to circulate in Europe," said Mr Macron.</p><p>The proposal was to be discussed in a video-summit with EU leaders on Tuesday afternoon hosted by European Council chief Charles Michel.</p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width">
